If they are able to find the Taiwanese, her body will be moved to a nearby overseas Taiwanese convention center in Mandalay.\nHer body will cremated before returning to Taiwan with her husband, he said.\nMeanwhile, a Taiwanese diplomat based in Yangon has finally arrived at Mandalay on Monday night and visited the collapsed hotel, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) told CNA in Taipei.\nTraffic to Mandalay, about 620 kilometers north of Yangon, was obstructed due to damaged roads after the strong earthquake, according to MOFA.\nUpon arrival, the diplomat was told that the trapped national had no vital signs, MOFA said in a statement.\nThe diplomat expressed the government's condolences to Lin. Taiwan's top envoy to Myanmar, Chou Chung-hsing (周中興), also telephoned Lin and pledged that the government will help him deal with the aftermath of his wife's death, MOFA said."

UMC had a 4.7 percent share of the global pure play wafer foundry market in the fourth quarter of 2024, ranking fourth in the world.\nGlobalFoundries ranked fifth with a 4.6 percent share.\nIf the two companies were to merge, their combined market share of 9.3 percent would top the respective 8.1 percent and 5.5 percent shares of second-ranked Samsung Electronics Co and third-ranked Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC).\nThe new entity, however, would still lag far behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), which had a 67.1 percent share in the fourth quarter due to strong demand for high-end chips used in artificial intelligence applications and cloud services.\nIn 2024, UMC posted a net profit of NT$47.21 billion, down 22.6 percent from a year earlier on a global supply glut in mature chips, with earnings per share at NT$3.80 compared with NT$4.93 a year earlier."

    "content": "Taipei, April 1 (CNA) Taiwan remains on the latest U.S. report on foreign trade barriers, released Monday by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), just two days before President Donald Trump is set to announce reciprocal tariffs.\nThe section of the report on Taiwan, which remained largely similar to the 2024 version, raised concerns over barriers to imports of meat and automobiles and raised questions over copyright issues.\nGiven the report's timing, it could put added pressure on Taiwan, as well as other listed countries, as the USTR said in a statement that the findings \"underscore President Trump's America First trade policy and [his] 2025 trade policy agenda.\"\nThough not yet confirmed, Taiwan is expected to be among the main targets of upcoming U.S. reciprocal tariffs, referred to as the \"dirty 15\" by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nOther potential members include Japan, the European Union, and China.\nThe report, submitted to Trump and the U.S. Congress, noted that despite a 2009 protocol reopening Taiwan's market to U.S. beef, Taipei continues to impose barriers on U.S. beef and beef byproducts.\nTaiwan detected a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 2003 and subsequently banned U.S. beef, though the 2009 protocol later reopened the market.\nThe USTR report said that some U.S. beef offal products, though permitted under the protocol, remain subject to port-of-entry inspections in Taiwan, which it described as \"onerous\" and \"not science-based.\"\nAdditionally, the report argued that Taiwan's labeling requirements and maximum residue limits for ractopamine -- a feed additive used in U.S. pork -- \"inaccurately implied that there is a food safety concern with U.S. pork products.\"\nThe U.S. also expressed dissatisfaction with Taiwan's restrictions on imported U.S. vehicles that meet U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.\nThe report asserted that these standards provide a level of safety equivalent to that of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's (UNECE) 1958 agreement, which Taiwan has adopted.\nAccording to the report, Taiwan's Ministry of Transportation and Communications first introduced a cap on such imports in 2008 and reduced it to 100 units per model in 2021, before furthering cutting it to 75 units per model in 2023.\nSuch a reduction, the report said, could hinder U.S. automakers from attracting consumers by periodically introducing unique new models.\nMeanwhile, the report raised continued concerns over online piracy, particularly unauthorized access to textbooks and copyrighted materials through on-campus digital platforms.\nDespite Taiwan's several attempts to amend its Copyright Act, the USTR pointed to legal loopholes and slow progress on pending amendments and their implementation, including some submitted to the Legislature in October 2017.\nAsked about the potential tariff plan on Tuesday, Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) said, without elaboration, that Taiwan's government was prepared, that the risks could be controlled, and that it would provide support to affected sectors."

Liu said the local bourse accounted for about 20 percent of the total investments by the funds.\nLiu said despite the short-term volatilities, the local stock market still enjoyed sound fundamentals in the longer term as Taiwan's economy continued to benefit from a stronger electronics sector riding the waves of emerging technologies.\nThe bureau said the labor funds have posted stable and sound in a recent decade, citing a rate of return of 6.88 percent between 2015 and February 2025.\nIn 2024, the labor funds posted gains of more than NT$1 trillion, which translated to a rate of return of 16.48 percent.\nMeanwhile, the Bureau of Public Service Pension Fund said on Tuesday that the Public Service Pension Fund managed by the bureau recorded NT$6.58 billion in gains in the first two to three months of 2025 with a rate of return at 0.65 percent."

    "content": "Bologna, March 31 (CNA) Seven popular Taiwanese illustrators and three intellectual property (IP) licensors are being featured at this year's Bologna Children's Book Fair, the world's largest international rights fair for children's literature that opened Monday.\nThe creators are being showcased at the show's Taiwan Pavilion, which is aimed at expanding Taiwan's reach in the global children's publishing industry, according to Theodore Huang (黃俊華), head of the international marketing division of the Taiwan Creative Content Agency, which put the pavilion together.\nThe seven Taiwanese illustrators are 2025 Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award nominees Chang Yeou-yu (張友漁) and Liu Hsu-kung (劉旭恭), as well as Ballboss (周宜賢), Chang Hsiao-chi (張筱琦), Lin Wei-ting (林蔚婷), Dong Dong (咚東, 劉韋廷), and A-Meow (阿喵, 蔡佩蓉), Huang said.\nLiu told CNA that he is participating in the children's book fair in Italy for the third time this year and that he was happy to take the occasion to engage in exchanges with content creators and publishing companies from other countries.\nThree Taiwanese IP licensors were also present at the Taiwan Pavilion to raise the international visibility of Taiwan's content creators.\nAmong them were Lee Yu-chieh (李郁婕), who currently oversees cartoon character Takokuma's international licensing operations, and her husband, Tsai Wei-hsin (蔡瑋信), the designer and copyright owner of Takokuma, according to Huang.\nTakokuma is a unique mix of an octopus and a bear and cannot be kept in a zoo because it has not been included in the encyclopedia of animals. Therefore, it started an adventure, said Lee, who serves as the producer of the animated series \"Takokuma's Adventure Story,\" while describing the story book.\nThrough the story, the writer hopes to convey the importance of self-identity and friendship and the idea that being different from others is still worth embracing, Lee said.\nShe added that after the release of the picture book, there have been multiple international collaborations related to the character, including the recent launch of capsule toys featuring the image in Japan.\nThere are also Takokuma stickers in the colors of the Italian flag that were made especially for the illustrators exhibition at the book fair, Lee said.\nThe Bologna Children's Book Fair will last until Thursday."

The double J tube will remain in Ko's body for about five days, the hospital added.\nDrugs were also prescribed and a schedule was set up for follow-up checks, the hospital said.\nOn March 30, Ko was allowed to briefly leave the detention center to receive off-site medical treatment after he reported \"feeling unwell.\"\nHe was sent back to the detention center the same day as doctors determined his condition was \"stable\" and did not meet the threshold for a hospital stay.\nOn March 10, he was allowed to leave the detention center to attend the funeral of his father in Hsinchu. His father, Ko Cheng-fa (柯承發), died aged 92 on Feb. 17.\nThe former TPP chairman has been detained since September 2024.\nHe was indicted in December on bribery, embezzlement and breach of trust charges dating back to his second term as Taipei mayor from 2018 to 2022 and during his run in the 2024 presidential race.\nKo, who denies the charges, made his first appearance at his trial on March 21."

    "content": "Taipei, April 2 (CNA) The stated aim of China's military drills around Taiwan is to deter \"Taiwan independence\" forces, but their real purpose may be to test the United States' response and strategic bottom line ahead of a potential Xi-Trump summit, scholars told CNA.\nThe People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Eastern Theater Command announced Tuesday that it had launched a new round of exercises around Taiwan using the army, navy, air and rocket forces to \"close in\" on Taiwan in \"multiple directions.\"\nChina's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) said Tuesday the drills were intended as \"a stern warning\" to \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces, and would serve as \"a resolute punishment\" for what it called the \"reckless provocations to seek independence\" by the administration of President Lai Ching-te (賴清德).\nThe PLA drills continued Wednesday, with Eastern Theater Command spokesperson Shi Yi (施毅) announcing in the morning that the command would launch exercises code-named \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" in the central and southern areas of the Taiwan Strait.\nLin Ying-yu (林穎佑), who teaches at Tamkang University's Graduate Institute of International Affairs and Strategic Studies, told CNA on Tuesday that the PLA exercises, coming just after U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's visit to Japan, were actually aimed at the U.S.\nDuring his first trip to Japan after taking office, Hegseth met with Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani in Tokyo and discussed security issues across the Strait.\n\"The ministers took note of activities by the PLA including the military situation around Taiwan, and emphasized the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\" an English-language press release issued by Japan's Ministry of Defense read.\nDespite its rhetoric of \"opposing Taiwan independence\" as the reason for launching the drills, China's decision to start them right after Hegseth's departure was more about testing the U.S.' bottom line and response regarding security issues across the Strait, Lin said.\nBeijing also wanted to understand U.S. President Donald Trump's stance on the issues, with the aim of gauging the U.S. strategic position ahead of a potential summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平), Lin said.\nEchoing Lin, Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), director of the Division of Defense Strategy and Resources at the Taiwan military-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said the drills were aimed at expressing political dissatisfaction toward Washington.\nSu said the dissatisfaction stemmed from a report by The Washington Post last Saturday, which said an internal guidance memo signed by Hegseth has reoriented the U.S. military to focus on deterring a potential seizure of Taiwan by China.\nBut while the PLA's surprise drills were primarily intended as a message to the U.S., they may also serve as internal propaganda in China, Su said.\nHe felt that they could be seen as a response to Lai's March 13 speech, in which he designated China a \"foreign adversary\" and announced 17 strategies to counter Beijing's coercion of Taiwan.\nSpeaking in the same vein, Chieh Chung (揭仲), a research fellow at the Association of Strategic Foresight, said the Lai administration was directly named in Tuesday's statements and in videos on the latest round of drills by both the TAO and the PLA Eastern Theater Command.\nSuch direct references to the Lai administration showed that the drills could be seen as a response to Lai's speech and the strategies he announced, Chieh said.\nHe also noted that the TAO statement Tuesday focused entirely on criticizing the Lai administration, without mentioning the U.S.\nThe criticism and the drills can thus be seen as signs that Beijing may be using Lai's remarks as a pretext to raise tensions across the Strait ahead of a potential Xi-Trump summit, in a bid to gain leverage or create opportunities for negotiation with the Trump administration, Chieh said."

TSMC's fall from the day's high cost the Taiex about 80 points, its losses contributed to respective 0.05 percent and 0.27 percent falls in the electronics index and semiconductor sub-index.\nTariff fears also led to the selling of other semiconductor stocks.

    "date": "2025-04-03",
    "content": "By Sunny Lai, CNA staff reporter\nOn April 3, 2024, Greek hiker Dimitris Belbas' quick thinking and years of scouting experience helped save the lives of 10 people trapped in Hualien County's Taroko Gorge by a devastating magnitude 7.1 earthquake.\nWhile Belbas -- dubbed \"a Greek hero\" by Taiwan's press -- escaped physical injury, the mental toll led to an eventual diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nA year on from the earthquake, Belbas is now turning his attention to raising awareness of mental health issues and reducing stigmas surrounding seeking help.\nDealing with traumaThe 51-year-old told CNA in a recent video interview from his home in Singapore that despite being initially open to recounting his experience, he increasingly began to feel \"something was wrong.\"Immediately after the quake, Belbas threw himself into his work, a choice which he said \"was not the best decision.\"\"I shouldn't have left my family. I shouldn't have jumped right away in trying to carry on with life. We humans sometimes want just to get over with and move on with our lives.\"Four days after the Hualien earthquake, Dimitris Belbas (right) is interviewed by CNA, before leaving his wife (left) and daughters in Taiwan for a business trip to Japan. CNA photo April 3, 2025Burdened by expectations to put on a brave face, Belbas said that many, particularly men, avoid discussing mental health issues. \"[I'm] a successful family person, a successful business person, why should I have any weaknesses?\"Belbas added that in the days following the earthquake, \"I felt sick. I was very weak. I couldn't eat anything. Slowly, what had happened was dawning on me.\"His subconscious occasionally betrayed his true feelings. In a post-rescue interview with CNA a few days after the quake, Belbas occasionally glanced at a bottle of water to check for tremors.At the suggestion of his longtime therapist, Belbas decided to stop media appearances. Instead, he focused on recovery: spending more time with his family, reducing business travel, and \"slowing down to take it all in.\"Belbas said \"the biggest lesson\" for those dealing with mental health issues is that they should feel \"safe asking for help.\"\"We are not superhuman, we are not,\" he added.Opening up againEarlier this year, Belbas felt ready to open up again.\"I'm more confident, I feel better talking about it again,\" Belbas said, noting that he can now look at the event \"from a different angle.\"As part of this, he has given talks on the technical aspects of his rescue efforts to schools and scout troops in a number of different countries.Almost a year after the earthquake, Dimitris Belbas shares his rescue experience at a primary school in Hong Kong in March, 2025. Photo courtesy of Dimitris Belbas\"It's very important to be prepared. If you go to the mountain, make sure you have the right clothes, the right shoes, and a jacket because you just never know what could potentially happen.\"Belbas added that retracing his actions during the rescue at public talks has also helped with his PTSD. \"It helps to talk about it after a certain period, and analyze it.\"Yet Belbas emphasized that proper preparation can only go so far in a disaster.He said that the most crucial factor in his group's survival in Taroko was \"we were all very lucky,\" having managed to avoid being hit by rocks and also found a tunnel to shelter in.\"There were 20 people who were unlucky on that day. It's very sad.\"The Hualien earthquake claimed 20 lives and injured over 1,000, with many parts of the county's infrastructure and tourist sites still awaiting restoration -- including the Baiyang Trail, where he was trapped, which remains closed to this day.Dimitris Belbas (third left) shares his rescue experience with the leadership of The General Association of the Scouts of China (Taiwan) (TGASC-Taiwan) in May 2024, at a time when he is still open to recounting the event.

CNA photo April 3, 2025In his public talks, Belbas said he tells those listening that his actions were not in the realm of the superhuman.\"I truly believe that everybody at a certain moment in time can provide assistance and help. Every one of us can be a hero.\"Returning to mental health, Belbas added that everybody should also feel free to seek help when necessary.Looking aheadIn May 2024, the Baiyang Trail hikers reunited in Taipei to watch Belbas throw the ceremonial first pitch at a Wei Chuan Dragons home game.Dimitris Belbas throws the ceremonial first pitch at a Wei Chuan Dragons home game in May 2024, after being invited in recognition of his rescue efforts. Photo courtesy of Wei Chuan Dragons\"I was more scared about the pitch than during the earthquake! I got a lot of pressure from my daughters not to embarrass them,\" Belbas said.The family of five he helped rescue has since become, in his words, \"a new family.\"Belbas said he remains in touch with them and hopes the bond continues \"for as long as possible.\"\"Something really good came out of it, out of a day of extreme danger,\" he said.Belbas has visited Taiwan six times since the quake, mainly due to work and family gatherings, but not Hualien -- yet.Dimitris Belbas (first right, front row) reunites with those he helped rescue from a rockfall-trapped trail during the Hualien earthquake, at a baseball game in May 2024.

Because you just never know. You never know what can happen. And we shouldn't waste opportunities.\"Enditem/ASG\n> Chinese Version"

    "date": "2025-04-03",
    "content": "Taipei, April 3 (CNA) The Executive Yuan on Thursday decried U.S. President Donald Trump's 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese goods announced hours earlier and said it would lodge a representation with Washington.\nIn a news release, the Cabinet described the pledged American tariffs, expected to take effect on April 9, as \"deeply unreasonable\" and \"highly regrettable.\"\nCabinet spokesperson Michelle Lee (李慧芝) said the government would \"lodge a solemn representation\" with the United States Trade Representative and continue negotiating with the U.S. to \"ensure the interests of our nation and industries.\"\nAt a news conference in Washington, Trump announced a 10 percent baseline tariff on most goods imported to the U.S., set to take effect on April 5.\nHowever, Taiwan and dozens of other countries, including some of America's main trading partners, will face much higher duties, in what Trump described as an effort to address \"unbalanced\" trading relationships, reduce trade deficits, and boost American manufacturing capacity.\nIn particular, the Trump administration will impose a 32 percent \"reciprocal tariff\" on Taiwanese goods entering the U.S., starting April 9.\nThe \"reciprocal tariffs\" target countries that have enacted tariffs, manipulated currencies, subsidized exports, and implemented other trade barriers against the U.S., Trump said.\nNevertheless, certain goods, such as copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, energy and \"certain critical minerals\" will be exempt from such levies, according to the White House.\nIn the news release, Lee said the planned 32 percent tariff was \"unfair to Taiwan\" because it \"does not accurately reflect the trade and economic situation\" between the two sides.\nTaiwan's exports to the U.S. have increased significantly in recent years mainly because of the surge in demand from the U.S. for semiconductors and artificial intelligence-related products, Lee said.\nLee said many Taiwanese information and communication companies had relocated their manufacturing from China to Taiwan due to American tariffs on goods from China in Trump's first term and the U.S. technology control policy against China over national security concerns.\nIn that regard, she went on, Taiwan should not be subject to high tariffs in view of its \"tremendous contributions to the U.S. economy and national security.\"\nAccording to Lee, Taiwan's government has been actively cracking down on transshipment by Taiwanese producers, a practice where goods are routed through a third country to alter their country of origin in order to benefit from lower duties imposed on that third country.\nThe spokesperson hence argued that Taiwan should not be treated in a similar way as Vietnam, which will face a 46 percent tariff, Cambodia (49 percent), and Thailand (36 percent), where the problems of transshipment are more pronounced.\nLee also criticized the \"unclear\" methodology, scientific basis, and international trade theory behind the U.S.' tariff measures.\nAccording to data from Taiwan's executive body, the U.S. ran a trade deficit with Taiwan at about US$73.9 billion in 2024, a year-on-year increase of 54.6 percent, making Taiwan the sixth largest source of trade deficits for the U.S.\nThe data also showed that in 2024, the total bilateral trade reached US$158.6 billion, up 24.2 percent compared to the previous year."

    "date": "2025-04-03",
    "content": "Taipei, April 3 (CNA) Taiwan's chip industry can now have a temporary reprieve, as semiconductors have been listed among imports exempted from the latest round of tariffs announced Wednesday by U.S. President Donald Trump, an analyst said Thursday.\nThe exemption of semiconductors gave some insight into Trump's negotiation tactics, equity analyst Andy Hsu (許博傑) told CNA in a phone interview in Taipei.\n\"Trump made some tariff threats at first, then TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) pledged massive investments in the United States,\" Hsu said, referring to TSMC's announcement on March 3 that it would invest another US$100 billion in the U.S. state of Arizona over the next few years.\n\"For now, Taiwan's semiconductor industry can have a brief reprieve,\" Hsu said. \"But an unpredictable Trump means uncertainties remain, so I do not think the industry can stop worrying about tariff threats for too long.\"\nFurthermore, there are concerns about whether Trump would withhold the funding pledged by the previous U.S. administration for semiconductor investors such as TSMC under the CHIPS and Science Act, Hsu said.\nThe White House now has a goal to obtain billions more in commitments without the need to expand such grants, according to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a recent news report.\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the U.S.' trading partners, including a 32 percent tax on products from Taiwan, which will take effect on April 9.\nAt a Rose Garden event, Trump declared a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries, set to take effect on April 5. Countries with larger trade surpluses with the U.S. will face higher duties beginning April 9, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (25 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (36 percent), according to the White House.\nAn industrial expert told CNA Thursday that that the U.S. government might ask Taiwanese semiconductor suppliers to lower the prices of their products and services, including those in the pure wafer foundry, and IC designer, packaging and testing sectors.\nWhile big suppliers can afford to drop prices to appease the U.S. government, their smaller counterparts cannot make such big cuts, which might lead to a decline in their shipments or even a full exit from the market eventually, said the expert, who asked not to be named.\nMeanwhile, TSMC's response to the U.S.' latest tariff policies will be closely watched, as the company prepares to hold an investor conference on April 17, when it will release its first-quarter earnings data, give guidance for the second quarter and the entire year, and answer critical questions by investors on matters like U.S. tariffs.\nUnder TSMC's new US$100 billion investment plan, it aims to build three more advanced wafer fabs, two IC assembly plants and one research and development center in Arizona, which bring its total investments there to US$165 billion.\nThe chipmaker is already investing US$65 billion in Arizona to build three wafer fabs, the first of which started mass production at the end of 2024, using the sophisticated 4 nanometer process.\nThe second fab is under construction and is scheduled to begin commercial production in 2028, using the more sophisticated 3 nm, 2 nm, and A16 processes. TSMC Vice President for global policy Peter Cleveland said last week that the company is seeking to break ground on the third fab as soon as possible.\nTrump has said publicly on several occasions that TSMC's investments in the U.S. will hit US$200 billion or even US$300 billion, which analysts said raises the question of whether the Taiwanese chipmaker will pour more even funds into the U.S. amid the tariff threats.\nAnalysts have said there is also some worry about leaks of TSMC trade secrets if it yields to prospective U.S. government pressure to take a stake in Intel Corp.'s factories to improve the American chipmaker's pure play foundry operations."

    "content": "Taipei, April 3 (CNA) The head of one of Taiwan's leading economic think tanks on Thursday slammed the United States' method for calculating sweeping global tariffs, including a 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese goods, as \"simplistic and crude.\"\nIn a Facebook post, Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) President Lien Hsien-ming (連賢明) said his organization had been working under the wrong assumption about the U.S. tariffs.\nThe CIER, along with Taiwan's finance minister, believed that because of the complexity of calculating tariffs and the short time frame for doing so, the U.S. would opt for a uniform tariff on all countries, Lien said.\n\"As it turned out,\" he said, \"they had a unique way of calculating the reciprocal tariffs.\"\nAccording to Lien, Taiwan's tariff rate was calculated by dividing the countries' 2024 trade deficit (US$73.9 billion) by the total cost of goods the U.S. imported from Taiwan (US$116.2 billion). This works out to 63.6 percent, and was rounded up to 64 percent.\n\"Trump says he is merciful, and so Taiwan's tariff is set at 32 percent,\" or half of 64, Lien said, calling the method \"simplistic and crude.\"\nLien noted that in 2024, the trade deficit between the U.S. and Taiwan jumped from US$47.8 billion to US$73.9 billion, due to an increase in U.S. imports.\nIf the U.S. had used 2023 trade figures, and divided the trade deficit that year of US$47.8 billion by the total cost of goods the U.S. imported from Taiwan (US$87.7 billion), equaling 58 percent, the tariff would have been 29 percent, Lien said.\nTariff details\nAt a Rose Garden event Wednesday, Trump announced a baseline 10 percent tax on imports from all countries, taking effect April 5.\nCountries with larger trade surpluses with the U.S. will also face higher duties beginning April 9, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (26 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (37 percent).\nCrucially, semiconductors, one of Taiwan's top exports, as well as other products, including copper, pharmaceuticals and lumber articles, are not covered by the new tariff regime.\nTaiwan's government on Thursday described the tariffs as \"unreasonable\" and \"highly regrettable,\" and said it would lodge \"a solemn representation\" with the U.S. Trade Representative and continue negotiations with the U.S. to protect its interests."

The building he resides in then shook noticeably, but the shaking lasted only for a few seconds and no items in the house fell or were damaged, he said.\nEarlier Thursday, a magnitude 4.9 earthquake rattled Hualien County in eastern Taiwan at 2:01 a.m.\nThe epicenter of the temblor was located 19.1 kilometers north from Hualien County Hall, at a depth of 25.3 km, CWA data showed.\nThe strongest tremors were felt in Hualien, Yilan and Nantou counties, where the intensity reached level 3.\nThere were no immediate reports of damage following the quake.\nHowever, the shaking still woke up many residents in Hualien, and memories of the strong earthquake a year ago resurfaced, according to some of them.\nThursday marks the first anniversary since one of the worst natural disasters in recent years -- a magnitude 7.2 earthquake -- which struck Hualien on April 3, 2024, killing 18 people and injuring over 1,100."

    "date": "2025-04-03",
    "content": "Taipei, April 3 (CNA) The People's Liberation Army's (PLA) large-scale joint exercises around Taiwan on Tuesday were accompanied by strident propaganda comparing itself to a mighty monkey warrior in Chinese mythology and Taiwan's president to a parasite, but experts say these messages were primarily meant for domestic audiences and lost on the people in Taiwan.\nThe PLA Eastern Theater Command on April 1, when it announced the start of the exercises, released two videos on the Chinese Sina Weibo microblogging website.\nIn one of the videos, the PLA compared its air and naval forces to the mighty Monkey King from the Chinese literary classic \"Journey to the West\" (西遊記).\nThe video also included graphics from the hit Chinese video game \"Black Myth: Wukong,\" which was inspired by the novel, juxtaposed with aggressive footage of PLA forces targeting Taiwan's iconic Taipei 101 skyscraper and footage of what appeared to be the Wan Chun Fleet -- a fleet of CM-32 armored vehicles designated to protect Taiwan's president during major crises or emergencies -- cruising on Taipei's Hankou Street.\nAnother video shows a cartoon of Taiwan President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) depicted as a parasite held by its captor against the backdrop of a burning Taiwan ravaged by PLA forces.\nThe videos were likely meant to \"appease\" the Chinese people after recent events, including the deportation of Chinese national Liu Zhenya (劉振亞) a vlogger who often advocated the \"military takeover\" of Taiwan by China, Lin Ying-yu (林穎佑), an assistant professor at Tamkang University Graduate Institute of International Affairs and Strategic Studies, told CNA.\nChina also wants to placate public discontent about sweeping policies that Lai laid out to resist Chinese attempts to eliminate Taiwan's sovereignty and divide public opinion on the matter, Liu said.\nLai in March announced 17 measures resisting China's attempts to bring Taiwan into its fold, including strengthening defense capabilities and economic security, and creating \"action plans\" to collaborate with Taiwan's friends and diplomatic allies in demonstrating Taiwan's firm rejection of China's attempts to eliminate Taiwan's sovereignty.\nSu Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), a research fellow at Taiwan's government-funded Institute for National Defense and Security Research, agreed that the videos were primarily \"internal propaganda\" to galvanize the \"little pinks,\" a nickname for ethnocentric, unification-minded Chinese youths, amid recent reports of arrests of high-ranking PLA officials.\nThese include Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission He Weidong (何衛東) and PLA Eastern Theater Command Commander Lin Xiangyang (林向陽), both of whom are perceived as loyalists of Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平).\nOn top of that, Su said, China's uncertain economic outlook amid a heated trade war with the United States, as evidenced by a recent meeting between Xi and over 40 executives of international corporations on March 28 in a bid to attract foreign investment, could also explain the need to divert public attention.\nThe videos had a secondary objective: to wage psychological warfare against Taiwanese people and, with the help of \"local collaborators\" of the Chinese Communist Party, influence public opinion in Taiwan, Lin said.\nHowever, Lin argued that this will likely have a \"limited effect,\" as \"you're unlikely to change how you perceive yourself just because of those videos.\"\nSu, meanwhile, said if the propaganda had also targeted the Taiwanese public, it had failed completely on that front, as Taiwan's stock exchange proved unperturbed by the drills.\nThe Taiex, the Taiwan Stock Exchange's weighted index, ended up 584.27 points, or 2.82 percent on Monday, the first day of the two-day drills, and 18.05 points, or 0.08 percent, the next day.\n\"This showed that even the investors, who are usually most sensitive to potentially adverse outside factors, did not seem to care much about the drills,\" Su said.\nRegarding whether Taiwanese media should proactively report on such heavy-handed Chinese propaganda, given that not many people in Taiwan follow state-run CCP mouthpieces, Sung Wen-Ti (宋文笛), a sessional lecturer at Australian National University, argued that it should do so to build up the public's resiliency against propaganda.\n\"Democracies thrive on the free flow of information to create a more informed and resilient citizenry, as resiliency comes from exposure therapy, not protective bubbles,\" Sung said.\n\"What democracies need is a counterbalance against propaganda with better information, so as to build information literacy and immunity,\" Sung added.\nLin also said that the Taiwanese media should still report on the PLA rhetoric, provided that it provides factual information to counter any unfounded claims in propaganda to avoid \"perpetuating disinformation.\""

After questioning, police transferred her to prosecutors for further investigation.\nThe infant is scheduled for an autopsy on April 9 to clarify the exact cause of death.\nAccording to the Budai Precinct, a township resident saw the body of an infant in a partially-covered cardboard box on Wednesday morning while preparing to ride a motorcycle to work.\nThe individual called police at once, but they did not take the infant to a hospital because he was \"obviously dead.\"\nA preliminary examination found no visible injuries on the infant, but livor mortis had set in and the umbilical cord remained attached, investigators said.\nWith no reports of nearby residents hearing any crying, the baby was likely already dead when abandoned, they said.\nInvestigators believe the mother, who is married and raises a toddler, was able to conceal the pregnancy from her family due to her physique, and police said she did not undergo any prenatal checkups.\nCurrently it is unknown if the baby was stillborn in late March or died postpartum."

    "date": "2025-04-04",
    "content": "Taipei, April 4 (CNA) With U.S. President Donald Trump's new tariffs set to take effect in the coming days, scholars on Friday said the move aims to pressure countries into negotiations to reduce trade deficits, while security ties with allies will remain unaffected.\nThe scholars were reacting to Trump's announcement on Wednesday (Washington time) of sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of countries, including Taiwan, whose exports to the United States will face an import duty of 32 percent starting April 9.\nChen Shih-min (陳世民), an associate professor at National Taiwan University's Department of Political Science, told CNA that tariffs are not the main focus but rather a tool to pressure other countries into negotiations with the Trump administration.\nChen said Trump's primary goal is to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, as reflected in the formula used to calculate the upcoming \"reciprocal tariffs\" -- by dividing the U.S. goods trade deficit with a country by that country's exports to the U.S., converting the result into a percentage, and then halving it.\nTaiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. stood at just over US$20 billion during Trump's first term but had grown to more than US$70 billion last year, according to Chen.\nSuch growth was largely driven by the rise of artificial intelligence and the surge in semiconductor exports from companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in recent years, Chen said.\n\"For Taiwan, the problem is not difficult to solve,\" he said, adding that to achieve the goal of reducing its trade surplus with the U.S., Taiwan could increase its procurement of American goods.\nOne example he cited was a recent move by Taiwan's state-run CPC Corp., which signed a letter of intent for trade and investment with Alaska LNG last week, agreeing to purchase liquefied natural gas from the U.S. state of Alaska.\nChen noted that Taiwan lacks domestic energy resources such as natural gas and oil, and shifting its energy purchases from the Middle East or Africa to the U.S. could help reduce the trade surplus with the U.S.\nFollowing in the same vein, Kuo Yu-jen (郭育仁), chair of National Sun Yat-sen University's Institute of China and Asia-Pacific Studies, said that countries like Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea were likely to pursue negotiations with the U.S. and adjust their trade models accordingly.\nSuch approaches would differ from that of China, which will take countermeasures by imposing broad-based tariffs on U.S. goods, and the European Union, which might respond more mildly by targeting specific products with symbolic tariffs, Kuo said.\nAs for the impact on U.S. security ties with its allies, Kuo said they will remain unaffected despite the deteriorating economic and trade relationships between the U.S. and other countries.\nUnlike his recent decisions to give orders for the U.S. to withdraw from multilateral organizations such as the World Health Organization, Trump is now maintaining the \"minilateral\" security frameworks established under his predecessor, Joe Biden, Kuo said.\nHe cited the AUKUS (Australia-United Kingdom-United States) security partnership as an example, noting that under the partnership's agreement, U.S. Virginia-class fast attack submarines will be stationed in Australia -- a country also included on Trump's list that is set to face a 10 percent baseline tariff.\nKuo further noted that the U.S., Japan, and South Korea had just conducted a joint naval exercise last week near South Korea's Jeju Island, with the \"Balikatan\" joint military exercises between the U.S. and the Philippines set to take place later in April.\nAll three Asian countries are included on Trump's \"reciprocal tariffs\" list, with Japan facing a 24 percent tariff, South Korea 25 percent, and the Philippines 17 percent."

They are rehearsals for the forced unification of Taiwan,\" the report quoted Paparo as saying at the Honolulu Defense Forum in February.\nThe report said that the special communication channel was also used in August 2024 during the administration of then U.S. President Joe Biden.

Both Wang and Moya came around to score, sealing the walk-off victory.\nJhang, who had gone hitless in his first three at-bats Friday, admitted he was nervous stepping into the box, afraid he might fail to bring the runners home.\n\"I calmed myself down when I thought about how I had veteran teammates like Wu Nien-ting (吳念庭) behind me,\" the third-year catcher said. \"So I just went up there and swung aggressively.\"\nThat swing earned him MVP of the game in front of 15,487 fans.\nThe win also gave relief to Hawks manager Hung I-chung (洪一中), who avoided his first 0-4 season start since taking the reins in 2004.\nHung is the only manager to record 1,000 wins in the CPBL's 36-year history.\nMonkeys starter Jonathan Bermudez allowed just one run -- Moya's solo homer in the second -- over 5 2/3 innings, while Hawks starter Bradin Hagens, who had suited up for the Monkeys from 2021-2023, gave up two earned runs over six innings. Both pitchers ended with no decisions.\nLin Shi-xiang (林詩翔) picked up the win after keeping the Monkeys off the board in the ninth.

The live-fire component of the exercises is scheduled to be held July 9-18.\nThe wargames will create scenarios in which the frequent military exercises by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) escalate into a real attack on Taiwan, according to Major General Tung Chi-hsing (董冀星), director of the Ministry of National Defense's (MND) joint operations planning division.\nThe Han Kuang wargames will also simulate PLA \"gray zone\" activities, which are defined as provocative or aggressive actions that fall just short of an open conflict, Tung said at a press briefing Wednesday.\nOn Friday, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Wang Ting-yu (王定宇) said that the 2025 wargames would be longer than in previous years, running for two weeks compared to eight days in 2024, which would indicate an expansion of the simulations.\nIn Taiwan, the public used to think that a \"first strike\" by China would likely come in the form of a missile attack, said Wang, a member of the Legislature's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, in an interview with CNA.\nHowever, it is more realistic now to think that a \"first strike\" would involve equipment such as maritime militia vessels, sand dredgers, and drones, which as commonly used in \"gray zone\" operations, Wang said.\nHe said Taiwan's military now has to consider how to deal with situations that may go beyond traditional force-on-force confrontations. These include how to respond to \"gray zone\" activities within the bounds of international law, while preventing Chinese military drills from escalating into a full-scale invasion, Wang said.\nSuch complex scenarios require detailed planning and simulation, which makes the wargames more time-consuming, he said.\nSu Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), director of the Division of Defense Strategy and Resources at the Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research, expressed similar views Friday, saying that Taiwan's wargames this year were extended to two weeks most likely to facilitate more scenarios involving \"gray zone\" activities.\nWhen the PLA is conducting its naval and air patrols around Taiwan, it usually deploys six to 10 warships, Su noted in an interview with CNA.\nIf each of those PLA warships was equipped with vertical launching systems, there could be around 500 land-attack cruise missiles ready to strike targets across Taiwan, he said.\nThose cruise missiles could reach targets across Taiwan within three minutes, leaving defense forces with even less response time than if Dongfeng missiles were launched across the Taiwan Strait from mainland China, Su said.\nIt is therefore critically important to simulate such scenarios in Taiwan's wargames, particularly as the threats posed by PLA warships have become more frequent in recent years, he added.\nPreparing for 2027\nSu also noted that Defense Minister Wellington Koo (顧立雄) had said in a recent legislative hearing that this year's Han Kuang exercises would be based on a hypothetical invasion by the PLA in 2027.\nThat is because 2027 will mark several milestones in China, Su said, listing landmark events such as the 100th anniversary of the PLA's founding, the start of Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) fourth term in office, and the 12th year of Xi's ongoing military reforms.\nSuch milestones could provide political and military incentives for Xi, who will turn 74 in 2027, to take certain actions, including a full-scale invasion of Taiwan, Su said.\nThe focus of this year's Han Kuang exercises on a possible 2027 invasion reflects a \"worst-case scenario\" and risk management approach by Taiwan's military, he said.\nThis year's exercises can test how the MND would respond in the event of a 2027 invasion and assess any shortcomings in the readiness of Taiwan's armed forces and its arsenal of weapons, Su said.\nThe year 2027 is seen by some military experts as a potential flashpoint for Chinese military action against Taiwan. It came to the fore in 2021, when Philip Davidson, who was then head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said that Taiwan was \"clearly one of their [China's] ambitions\" and warned that \"the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact, in the next six years.\"\nSince then, the year 2027 has been referred to as the \"Davidson window,\" with several U.S. military and political figures warning that China is aiming to develop the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027 and that both the U.S. and Taiwan should be prepared for such an eventuality."

    "content": "Taipei, April 5 (CNA) Taiwanese textile and furniture companies that have large production bases in Southeast Asia have expressed concerns about their ability to navigate the risks caused by the latest round tariffs imposed by the United States on countries worldwide.\nEclat Textile Co., a Taiwanese supplier to major international sportwear brands like Nike, Lululemon and Under Armour, said Thursday that 60 percent of its garment sales come from the U.S. market.\nIn an interview with CNA, the textile supplier said 60 percent of its total production is in Vietnam, 27 percent in Indonesia, and 10 percent in Cambodia, which means it is now facing increasing risks.\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced what he called reciprocal tariffs on countries worldwide, ranging from 10 percent to more than 40 percent, with effect from April 9.\nOn Trump's list, a 32 percent tariff was imposed on Taiwan, 34 percent on China, 49 percent on Cambodia, 46 percent on Vietnam, 36 percent on Thailand, and 32 percent on Indonesia.\nAccording to Eclat, even with its diversified production bases, it cannot escape the fallout of the new tariffs.\nEclat said it will work closely with its suppliers to improve production efficiency, so as to cap costs, and will set up strategic partnerships with its clients as means of weathering the turbulence caused by Trump's policies.\nWhile some Taiwanese companies are considering investing in the U.S. market to avoid the tariffs, Eclat said it will be difficult for the textile industry to expand its production to the U.S. in light of the high labor costs and shortage of suppliers in the textile industry.\nMeanwhile, Makalot Industrial Co., which manufactures garments such as pants, underwear and sleepwear, also said it is worried about the financial impact of Trump's tariffs on Southeast Asian countries.\nThe U.S. accounts for more than 70 percent of Makalot's total sales revenue, while 41 percent of its total production is based in Indonesia, 37 percent in Vietnam, and 14 percent in Cambodia, the company told CNA.\nMakalot said it will hold international meetings next week and engage in discussions with its clients to find ways to share the expected financial burden caused by Trump's latest tariffs.\nMeanwhile, a leading Taiwanese manufacturer of footwear Pou Chen Corp. also told CNA that it will hold discussions with its clients to figure out the best response to the tariffs.\nPou Chen, which is a contract supplier to major international brands such as Nike, Adidas, and New Balance, has 53 percent of its production in Indonesia and more than 30 percent in Vietnam, according to market estimates.\nApart from textile companies, other Taiwanese firms are also bracing for the impact of the U.S. tariffs, including furniture manufacturers Shane Global Holding Inc. and Nien Made Enterprise Co.\nShane Global has 64 percent of its production in China and Cambodia, while Nien Made has a total of 80 percent in those two countries, market estimates show.\nSeveral Taiwanese companies in the tech sector also have large production lines in Southeast Asian countries.\nOn Friday, Taiwan's top economic planning body the National Development Council (NDC) said it would provide assistance to Taiwanese manufacturers in Southeast Asia that wish to return to Taiwan.\nNDC head Liu Chin-ching (劉鏡清) told reporters that the government will optimize Taiwan's investment environment to help Taiwanese firms improve their global competitive edge."

Originally from southeastern China's Fujian province, she was a Fujianese shamaness believed to have special powers in protecting fishermen and seafarers.\nOver the centuries, worship of Mazu spread throughout China's coastal regions and overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Belief in Mazu was brought by early Chinese settlers to Taiwan, where it is still extensively practiced.\nIn later years, the deity came to be regarded as a benevolent protector of all, not just fishermen and seafarers."

    "title": "Taiwan investment in U.S. will not cause industrial hollowing out: DGBAS",
    "date": "2025-04-05",
    "content": "Taipei, April 5 (CNA) With the Trump administration using tariffs in part to encourage Taiwanese manufacturers to invest massively in the United States, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said on Saturday such fund flight would not cause the industrial hollowing out of Taiwan.\nAmid Trump's tariff threats, contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) has pledged to invest an additional US$100 billion in the U.S. state of Arizona to build three more advanced wafer fabs, two IC assembly plant and one research and development center, bringing its total investment to US$165 billion in the U.S. state.\nWith TSMC's plans to invest in the U.S., many of its suppliers are mulling following the chipmaker to obviate tariff risks. However, the DGBAS dismissed concerns over possible industrial hollowing out in Taiwan which could repeat the low economic growth three decades ago when Taiwanese investors rushed to China and reduced their investments in Taiwan.\nDGBAS Department of Statistics chief Tsai Yu-tai (蔡鈺泰) told CNA that 30 years ago, many Taiwanese firms wanted to benefit from low labor costs in China and enjoyed prosperity for a while. Indeed, investment in China became a major trend after Taiwan's government lifted a ban on China-bound investment in the 1990s, when environmental awareness became more prevalent at home, Tsai said.\nHowever, most of these Taiwanese firms from old economy industries such as petrochemical, textile, food and metal firms did not focus on high-end technology development, Tsai said, so they were replaced by Chinese counterparts when China intensified efforts to cultivate its own industries.\nUnder such circumstances, Tsai said, Taiwan's economic development gap with China narrowed and its economy fell into low growth mode, leading to the hollowing out of industrial development.\nIn contrast, as a result of the trade war between the U.S. and China in recent years, many Taiwanese firms mulled launching operations in the U.S. to avoid high tariffs, Tsai said.\nIt was easy for old economy industries like petrochemical firms to be replaced by Chinese counterparts, but the semiconductor industry is very different, he added.\nTSMC is already investing US$65 billion in Arizona to build three wafer fabs, the first of which started mass production at the end of 2024, using the sophisticated 4 nanometer process.\nThe second fab is under construction and scheduled to begin commercial production in 2028, using the more sophisticated 3nm, 2nm, and A16 processes. TSMC is seeking to break ground on the third fab as soon as possible.\nAlthough Tsai admitted political factors influenced semiconductor firms like TSMC to some extent when deciding to go to the U.S., the company places greater emphasis on whether it can capitalize on investments and rake in profits.\nIn addition, many of these semiconductor firms consider Taiwan to be their home and keep the latest technologies at home by spending more on R&D, Tsai said.\n\"It is unnecessary to worry semiconductor firms' knowhow will be stolen when they go to the U.S.,\" Tsai said. \"The U.S. market is a capital-intensive place so investing there is expected to help Taiwanese semiconductor firms upgrade their technologies.\"\nAs Taiwan has limited manpower and resources, the U.S. is expected to make up such a shortage by using its high-end tech professionals to advancing R&D efforts, he added.\nTSMC has repeatedly said its investments in the U.S. aims to cater to its American clients and meet demand from them.\nEchoing Tsai, Wang Jiann-chyuan (王健全), vice president of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER), said Taiwanese high tech manufacturers will have to consider their customer base and raw material supplies when they decide to go to the U.S. market. Wang added it is not easy to quickly replicate the semiconductor ecosystem that exists in Taiwan.\nInvestment in the U.S. is expected to extend Taiwan's footprint by taking advantage of technologies, talent and the capital market there to help Taiwan's industry to grow, adding as long as companies list their shares on the U.S. stock markets, they can use the U.S. capital market to make themselves stronger, Wang said.\nCurrently, TSMC and several Taiwanese companies such as United Microelectronics Corp., a smaller contract chipmaker, have listed their American depositary receipts on the U.S. market.\nPai Tsung-cheng (白宗城), head of the Supply Management Institute, said if Taiwan is able to use the world as its base to grow, that will help Taiwanese firms to seize on more global business opportunities."

    "date": "2025-04-05",
    "content": "Washington, April 4 (CNA) As a 32 percent U.S. tariff on Taiwanese goods looms, a former U.S. diplomat told CNA that Taiwan should clearly express to the United States that the \"reciprocal tariff\" is unfair and unjustified, noting that despite an imbalance, the Taiwan-U.S. trade relationship is \"mutually beneficial.\"\n\"Both the Taiwan government and Taiwan industry should make a clear and forceful case to the U.S. that 'reciprocal tariffs' are unfair, excessive, and unjustified,\" said Kurt Tong, who is now a managing partner at the Asia Group, a strategic advisory firm based in Washington D.C.\nThe \"reciprocal tariffs\" Tong referred to stem from an announcement made by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, in which he unveiled sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of countries, including Taiwan, whose exports to the U.S. face a 32 percent import duty starting April 9.\nIn an interview with CNA on Thursday, Tong noted that Trump has said that the \"reciprocal tariffs\" are based on a calculation of both tariff and non-tariff barriers imposed by Taiwan on entry into the Taiwanese market by American exporters.\n\"But I think the calculation seems flawed and excessive,\" said Tong, who served as the principal deputy assistant secretary for economic and business affairs at the U.S. State Department from 2014-2016.\nHe added that the measure comes with an agenda \"beyond reciprocity,\" including forcing investment into the U.S. and boosting government revenue.\nEchoing Tong, Riley Walters, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute specializing in international economics, told CNA that the calculations behind the new U.S. tariffs are based on \"bad math\" and appear \"quite unfair.\"\n\"What the White House has been doing is they will mention tariffs and they will mention non-tariff barriers, but the calculation that they've used is based purely on the trade deficit,\" Walters said.\nHe noted that the Trump administration is \"by proxy\" saying that the trade deficit is an immediate result of those tariffs and non-tariff barriers, \"which isn't entirely true at all.\"\nWalters also said it is unlikely Taiwan imposes such high tariffs, adding that much of the U.S. trade deficit stems from American demand for products like routers, servers and other ICT goods.\nTong said that while the Taiwan-U.S. trade is imbalanced due to Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S., the trade relationship between the two countries is actually \"mutually beneficial.\"\n\"U.S. companies benefit not just from their sales to Taiwan, but also from the imports that the U.S. buys from Taiwan -- so that case needs to be made clearly and forcefully,\" Tong said.\nTong added that it \"makes sense\" for Taiwan's government to seek negotiations with the Trump administration but noted that achieving a successful outcome would be a \"complex and difficult process.\"\n\"This will take some time,\" he said.\nFollowing the same vein, Walters predicted that tariff reductions for countries like Taiwan, which face rates above 10 percent, are unlikely to happen within the coming week -- but could come \"six months from now, a year from now.\"\n\"The real costs of these tariffs are starting to be seen in the U.S. economy, not just the stock market -- so maybe then there's an opportunity,\" Walters said.\nHolding an opposite view, Jeffrey Kuo (郭哲瑋), an economics lecturer at George Washington University, said the \"reciprocal tariffs\" are likely a short-term policy aimed at fulfilling Trump's campaign promise to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., with more political symbolism than economic substance.\nKuo said there is about a week before the \"reciprocal tariffs\" take effect, and the Trump administration is likely to use that window to engage in talks with other countries, using the measure as leverage to achieve certain goals -- after which the tariffs could be reduced.\nIf the \"reciprocal tariffs\" are imposed as scheduled next Wednesday, Kuo said it could signal the beginning of a new era of protectionist trade policies around the globe. For export-driven economies like Taiwan, he added, \"this is not a good thing.\""

(TRC) and the Railway Police Bureau said.In an apparent panic, the man climbed onto the coupling between the third and fourth carriages as the train was leaving the station, the authorities said.TRC said that its personnel at Xizhi Station in New Taipei noticed something suspicious on surveillance camera monitors, and they informed the train conductor and control center of the issue at around 8.15 p.m. Saturday.According to the authorities, when the train was ordered to stop at Qidu Station in Keelung City, the man went down on the track and was then pulled on to the platform by railway police.Tsai, aged around 40 years old, was not injured during the incident, which caused no more than a five-minute delay at Qidu Station, the state-run railway company said.However, Tsai now faces a fine of between NT$1,500 (US$45.18) to NT$7,500, the Railway Police Bureau said, citing Articles 57 and 71 of the Railway Act.Following the incident, TRC is urging passengers to adhere to safety rules and avoid putting themselves and others in danger.\n(By Yu Hsiao-han, Wang Chao-yu and James Thompson) \nEnditem/pc"

Among the goods exported to the U.S., competitive ICT products and electronic components made up 65.4 percent--a sign that Taiwan's economy remains highly resilient, he said.\n\"Taiwan has no plans to take retaliatory tariff action in response to the United States' 'reciprocal tariffs.' Investments by Taiwanese companies in the U.S. will also proceed without any changes, as long as they align with our national interests,\" Lai said in the 8-minute video.\nTo mitigate the impact of the tariffs, Lai said his government has formed a negotiation team led by Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun (鄭麗君) to launch formal talks with the United States.\n\"The tariff negotiations can start with a goal of \"zero tariffs,\" modeled after the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement),\" Lai said.\nThe government also plans to expand purchases of American goods -- including agricultural, industrial, petroleum and natural gas products, and defense equipment -- in a bid to reduce the trade deficit, the president said.\nLai said his government will also assist Taiwanese companies to expand their investments in the United States, such as in the electronics, ICT, petrochemicals, and natural gas industries.\nIt will also work to eliminate long-standing non-tariff barriers and address U.S. concerns over export controls on high-tech products and the illegal relabeling of low-cost goods, he said.\nDomestically, Lai said the government will support industries most affected by the new tariffs, especially traditional and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), accelerate industrial transformation, and leverage Taiwan's strengths in semiconductors and smart manufacturing to position the country as a leader in artificial intelligence applications.\nLai's video address was released after he met with a dozen representatives from traditional industries and SMEs, in his second day of talks with industry representatives in response to the new tariffs.\nIn response to Lai's address, Eric Chu (朱立倫), chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), questioned whether the government had thoroughly assessed the situation before urging Taiwan's private sector to increase investments in the U.S.\nChu pointed out that chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) had already committed to an additional US$100 billion investment in the U.S., and warned that further pressure from the government to increase this investment could put Taiwan at risk of losing its most valuable \"silicon shield.\"\nAlso Sunday, the KMT held a news conference during which it criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over what it said was its slow response to Trump's tariffs.\nKMT Taoyuan City Councilor Ling Tao (凌濤) said the Cabinet's NT$88 billion (US$2.65 billion) proposal, announced on Friday to support Taiwanese businesses facing significant impact from the tariff, is insufficient to help local companies.\nLing said the government should immediately appoint a special envoy to initiate talks with the U.S. and use TSMC's investment in the U.S. as a bargaining chip in tariff negotiations."

The negotiations \"can start with a goal of 'zero tariffs,' modeled after the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement),\" he said.\nIn an interview with CBS News on Sunday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said \"there is no postponing\" the newly announced tariffs, regardless of ongoing negotiations.\nOn Monday, Taiwan's stock market plunged more than 2,000 points at the opening bell and soon fell below the 20,000 mark.

(TSMC), the most heavily weighted stock on the local market, had tumbled 10 percent to NT$848.00 (US$25.54).\nThe markets in Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia were roiled by Trump's latest tariff policy, announced on April 3, which imposes a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries starting April 5.\nEffective April 9, countries with larger trade surpluses with the U.S. will face higher tariffs, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (26 percent), Vietnam (46 percent), and Thailand (37 percent), according to the new policy."

(TSMC), fell by the maximum 10 percent amid concerns that the tariffs could undermine global trade, dealers added.\nThe Taiex, the TWSE's benchmark weighted index, ended down 2,065.87 points, or 9.7 percent, at 19,232.35 after moving between 19,212.02 and 20,153.57.\nIt was the first time the index had closed below the 20,000-point mark since Aug. 5, 2024, when it ended at 19,830.88.\nMonday's losses were the steepest ever in the Taiex's history, smashing the previous record of 1,807.21 also seen on Aug. 5, 2024, when disappointing U.S. data prompted investors to worry about the economy.\nDespite the sell-off, turnover on the local market totaled only NT$147.295 billion (US$4.44 billion), the lowest single day total in more than two years.\n\"The low turnover showed many investors were reluctant to buy the dip as they expect more losses to follow due to the tariff shocks,\" Mega International Investment Services analyst Alex Huang said.\nOn April 2, Trump announced a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from most countries, with the exception of Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus, starting April 5.\nCountries with larger trade surpluses with the U.S. will face higher tariffs starting April 9, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (26 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (37 percent).\nChina took retaliatory action soon after Trump's newest move.\n\"The 32 percent tariff Taiwan faces went beyond what the market had expected, in particular after TSMC pledged (in March) to pour an additional US$100 billion into Arizona in support of Trump's advocacy for investment in the U.S. market,\" Huang said.\nTSMC, the most heavily weighted stock here, plunged 10 percent to close at NT$848.00, contributing more than 750 points to the Taiex's decline and contributing to a 9.71 percent decline in the electronics index.\n\"Orders to sell an additional 68 million TSMC shares failed to find buyers today. More selling will follow after the market opens tomorrow as investors fear Trump's tariffs will boost inflation and lead to a recession,\" Huang said.\nAmong other semiconductor stocks that also fell 10 percent, smartphone IC designer MediaTek Inc. ended at NT$1,295.00, contract chipmaker United Microelectronics Corp. closed at NT$40.75, and memory chip supplier Nanya Technology Corp. ended at NT$37.00.\nSecond to TSMC in terms of market value, iPhone assembler and artificial intelligence server supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and another AI server maker, Quanta Computer Inc., also fell by the maximum 10 percent to NT$138.50 and NT$210.00, respectively.\nHuang said non-tech heavyweights also came under heavy pressure, pushing the Taiex down further.\nAlso falling 10 percent, Formosa Plastics Corp., Nan Ya Plastics Corp., Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. closed at NT$34.40, NT$28.30, NT$24.90 and NT$33.95, respectively.\nIn addition, textile brand Far Eastern New Century Corp. and China Steel Corp., the largest steel maker in Taiwan, also shed 10 percent to end at NT$30.45 and NT$20.60, respectively.\nIn the financial sector, which lost 9.89 percent, Fubon Financial Holding Co. and Cathay Financial Holding Co. plunged by the maximum to close at NT$78.90 and NT$55.50, respectively, while Chang Hwa Commercial Bank ended down 9.14 percent at NT$16.40.\nOnly some telecom stocks appeared resilient, Huang said, with Chunghwa Telecom Co. down 4.62 percent to close at NT$124.00, Taiwan Mobile Co. down 2.59 percent at NT$113.00, and Far EasTone Telecommunications Co. down 4.64 percent to close at NT$88.40.\n\"There are few signs of any immediate rebound as the Taiex, which resumed trading today after the last session on April 2, needs to incur more losses to match global volatility,\" Huang said. \"So a similar trading pattern is likely for tomorrow.\"\nMeasures to curb short selling were put in place before trading Monday and will remain in effect through Friday in a bid to calm the market, though it made little impact Monday.\nAccording to the TWSE, foreign institutional investors bought a net NT$16.82 billion in shares Monday.\nUpdate► Stabilization fund could hold special meeting to ease volatility► Measures to stabilize Taiwan dollar ready if needed: Central bank"

    "date": "2025-04-08",
    "content": "Washington, April 7 (CNA) President Lai Ching-te's (賴清德) recent statement that he is not planning to retaliate against United States President Donald Trump's 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese goods should be welcomed by Washington, American scholars told CNA on Monday.\nBut they were also wary of Lai's aim to conduct tariff negotiations modeled after the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement).\nFormer U.S. diplomat Robert S. Wang (王曉岷) said Lai's \"conciliatory response\" would likely be welcomed by the U.S. administration, \"especially in sharp contrast to Beijing's immediate retaliatory actions.\"\n\"I think Taiwan's response would likely be brought to the attention of high-level U.S. officials, possibly including President Trump who of course personally met with TSMC CEO [C.C.] Wei (魏哲家) recently,\" he told CNA in an email responding to a question on Lai's decision.\nWhen asked about the possibility of pursuing a USMCA type deal, Wang, who served as senior U.S. official for APEC from 2013 to 2015, said contacts with the U.S. could lead to the beginning of informal talks.\nThose talks, however, \"would probably only focus on the current tariff issues rather than on a long-term agreement,\" said Wang, who is currently a senior associate with the Asia Program at the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\"I think that what he [Lai] already said about examining ways to expand U.S. imports [into Taiwan] should be a good way of starting the talks. These could include petroleum and agricultural products that Taiwan needs,\" he said.\nCommenting on the same issue, Stephen Ezell, vice president of the Global Innovation Policy, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told CNA that he also believes the Trump administration would welcome Lai's decision and begin discussions aimed at reducing tariffs applied between both sides.\n\"That said, the Trump administration seems to want 10 percent tariffs as a baseline for all incoming imported products to the United States,\" he said in an email.\nEzell felt the pursuit of a USMCA-type deal was highly unlikely because it \"would be highly complex and time-consuming to complete, something which might be a stretch when U.S. trade agencies are stretched very thin at this time.\"\nA potential bilateral investment treaty \"might be more obtainable,\" he said.\nDerek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was more skeptical of any negotiations on the tariffs, given that \"the tariff rates are not based on policies other countries pursue.\"\n\"So changing those policies does not naturally lead to a cut in American tariffs. As a result, every country's offer must be evaluated on an individual basis, which the US Trade Representative is not staffed for,\" Scissors said.\nOn the possibility of free trade deal negotiations, Scissors said: \"There is absolutely no chance of a USMCA-like deal between the U.S. and Taiwan. Despite signing USMCA himself, President Trump now denounces it.\"\nOn Sunday, President Lai announced that his government has no plans to retaliate against Trump's 32 percent tariff set to start on April 9.\n\"Taiwan has no plans to take retaliatory tariff action in response to the United States' 'reciprocal tariffs.' Investments by Taiwanese companies in the U.S. will also proceed without any changes, as long as they align with our national interests,\" Lai said in an 8-minute video.\nTo mitigate the impact of the tariffs, Lai said his government has formed a negotiation team led by Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun (鄭麗君) to launch formal talks with the U.S.\n\"The tariff negotiations can start with a goal of 'zero tariffs,' modeled after the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement),\" Lai said.\nContrary to Taiwan's decision, China announced on Friday that it will impose reciprocal 34 percent tariffs on all imports from the U.S. starting April 10 in retaliation after Trump escalated a global trade war.\nIn response, Trump on Monday said the U.S. will apply an additional 50 percent tariff on imports from China if it does not withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory 34 percent import duty on American products."

    "content": "Taipei, April 8 (CNA) Eight local government leaders from cities and counties across Taiwan held an online meeting on Monday to discuss countermeasures in response to the 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese goods announced by U.S. President Donald Trump last week.\nIn a joint statement after the meeting, the eight leaders urged the central government to act swiftly, protect workers and safeguard vulnerable industries.\nThey also called on the Legislature to expedite the approval of a proposed NT$88 billion (US$2.67 billion) assistance package for affected industries and businesses.\nTaichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen (盧秀燕) organized the virtual conference with the mayors and county magistrates of Hsinchu County, Hsinchu City, Miaoli County, Changhua County, Nantou County, Yunlin County and Chiayi City.\nDuring the meeting, Lu said the tariffs would \"severely impact\" her city's export-driven manufacturing sector.\nHsinchu County Magistrate Yang Wen-ke (楊文科), acting Hsinchu City Mayor Andy Chiu (邱臣遠) and Miaoli County Magistrate Chung Tung-chin (鍾東錦) all voiced support for the central government's proposed NT$88 billion assistance plan.\nChanghua County Magistrate Wang Huei-mei (王惠美) stressed the importance of swift action, urging the central government to quickly understand the details of the U.S. tariffs policy to help businesses make more informed decisions.\nYunlin County Magistrate Chang Li-shan (張麗善) raised concerns about potential company closures and employee layoffs, and urged collaboration between local governments to strengthen the social safety net for workers.\nChiayi City Mayor Huang Min-hui (黃敏惠) recommended that aside from ensuring that state-funded banks do not tighten credit, the central government should also offer affected businesses preferential interest rates or tax reductions.\nNantou County Magistrate Hsu Shu-hua (許淑華) called on the central government to ensure that vulnerable sectors like agriculture would not be \"sacrificed\" during tariff negotiations with the United States.\nThe eight leaders -- six from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), one from the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), and one independent -- also urged the Democratic Progressive Party-led (DPP) central government to collaborate with local governments to help mitigate the potential impact of the tariff on Taiwanese businesses.\nMeanwhile, the mayors of four KMT-run cities in northern Taiwan -- Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, and Keelung -- are scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss the potential impact of the Trump tariff on local industries and possible responses, according to Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安).\nChiang said the mayors would exchange views on several issues, including the impact of the tariffs, subsidies, price monitoring, and industrial transformation."

    "date": "2025-04-08",
    "content": "Taipei, April 8 (CNA) Cheng Tsung-che (鄭宗哲) has been called up by the Pittsburgh Pirates from their Triple-A affiliate, becoming the first Taiwanese player to reach the majors in 2025.\nThe Pirates announced the promotion in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, saying, \"We have recalled [infielder] Tsung-Che Cheng from Triple-A Indianapolis and placed INF Jared Triolo on the 10-day injured list.\"\n\"I [was] really excited when I got the call. It's kind of like a dream come true,\" said Cheng, who is better known within the Pirates system as \"Z,\" in an introductory video released by the franchise.\nHis jersey number is 71.\nIt will be the first trip to the major leagues for the Pirates' No. 17 prospect, nearly five years after he made his professional debut in the Rookie Leagues in July 2021. Cheng is now the 18th Taiwanese player ever to play in the majors.\nThe most recent Taiwanese player to make it to the majors was Teng Kai-wei (鄧愷威), who had a four-game stint with the San Francisco Giants before being demoted. He is currently with the Giants' Triple-A team.\nThe Pirates' decision may have seemed somewhat premature, considering that Cheng has played only 11 games at the Triple-A level -- six at the end of the 2024 season and five so far in 2025.\nStill, the move was not entirely unexpected, given the team's lack of depth in the infield and Cheng's standout performance in spring training.\nIn addition to losing second baseman Nick Gonzales and utility player Jared Triolo, who were sidelined with a fractured left ankle and a lumbar spine strain, respectively, Nick Yorke, the team's No. 5 prospect according to MLB Pipeline, is also on the injured list.\nCheng, 23, bats left and throws right. In 17 at-bats over 14 spring training games, he tallied six hits, including one homer and two doubles, and hit .353.\nHis ability to play multiple infield positions effectively also set him apart from other potential call-up candidates.\nAs noted by Alex Stumpf, who featured Cheng's promotion in a recent piece, Cheng's 65-grade fielding tool is the highest among the Pirates' Top 30 prospects.\nScouting grades range from 20 to 80, with 60 considered above average and 70-80 indicating well-above-average tools.\n\"I think we saw the full scope of it in spring training,\" Pirates manager Derek Shelton was quoted by Stumpf as saying.\n\"Regardless if he played second or short, he can really defend. He's played some third, a little bit in the minor leagues. With losing Triolo, we needed someone who could play short as the backup. We felt he fit us the best,\" Shelton said.\nFor now, Cheng is expected to begin in a bench role. He did not appear in Monday's 8-4 win at home over the St. Louis Cardinals.\nFollowing the series opener, the Pirates (4-7) sit fourth in the National League Central division."

Lin, a Taiwanese-American, qualifies as a non-import because he got a Taiwan passport in 2020.\nLin earned the honor for non-imports for the second time in the league's inaugural season by averaging 23.8 points and 5.3 assists over four games, helping the Kings stay atop the seven-team league with a 4-1 record during the month.\nAmong his highlights was a 36-point performance against the Taoyuan Leopards on March 23, when he hit seven three-pointers in the Kings' 108-97 win.

Despite the reduced sell-off, Tuesday's losses were the eighth daily decline in history.\nTurnover totaled NT$548.95 billion (US$16.64 billion), up from about NT$166.10 billion a session earlier.\n\"Judging from today's movement, I think some bargain hunters jumped into the trading floor after yesterday's plunge as the U.S. markets showed signs of stabilizing,\" Moore Securities Investment Consulting analyst Adam Lin said, referring to the 0.10 percent rebound on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index after a fall of 5.82 percent Friday, and a 0.91 percent drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, compared with a 5.05 percent plunge a session earlier.\n\"TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) saw part of its earlier losses recouped, helping to ease volatility in the electronics sector as well as on the broader market,\" Lin said. \"I do not rule out the possibility that government-led funds stood behind the bargain hunting.\"\nAfter falling the maximum 10 percent Monday, contract chipmaker TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock here, fell 3.77 percent to close at NT$816.00 Tuesday but came off a low of NT$797.00. TSMC's recovery from the day's low helped the Taiex recover more than 150 points.\nOther semiconductor stocks also encountered less pressure with smartphone IC designer MediaTek Inc. down 2.70 percent to end at NT$1,260.00, and IC packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. down 5.20 percent to close at NT$127.50. However, TSMC's application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design unit Global Unichip Corp. still shed 10 percent to end at NT$900.00.\niPhone assembler and artificial intelligence server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market value, extended its 10 percent fall from a session earlier, falling by the maximum to close at NT$125.00.

However, Fubon Financial Holding Co. closed down 1.27 percent at NT$77.90.\n\"Whether and when the Taiex will have a meaningful rebound will depend on how the U.S. markets perform,\" Lin said. \"With tariff uncertainty in place, it is possible for investors to pocket profits whenever the index bounces back.\"\nAccording to the TWSE, foreign institutional investors sold a net NT$34.18 billion worth of shares on the main board Tuesday."

    "content": "San Jose, California, April 8 (CNA) An employment discrimination lawsuit against contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) may soon be expanded after a hearing was held in a federal court in San Jose on adding 15 plaintiffs to the case.\nAccording to a court document, the lawsuit, which was refiled in November 2024 as a form of a class action with 13 plaintiffs in California, wants to add 15 plaintiffs from Arizona, where TSMC is investing in wafer fab capacity.\nTSMC first committed between 2020 and 2024 to invest US$65 billion in three advanced wafer fabs in Arizona, the first of which began mass production in 2024.\nIt then pledged an additional US$100 billion in March 2025 to build three more fabs, two IC assembly plants and one research and development center in Arizona.\nThe employment discrimination lawsuit was first submitted in August 2024 on behalf of Deborah Howington, who reportedly began working for TSMC in February 2023 as a deputy director for talent acquisition at a company office in San Jose.\nThe refiled complaint in November 2024 alleged that as of Dec. 31, 2023, the vast majority of TSMC's 2,668 workers in North America were from Taiwan and China.\nThis shows an \"intentional pattern and practice of employment discrimination against individuals who are not of East Asian race, not of Taiwanese or Chinese national origin, and who are not citizens of Taiwan or China.\"\nThese include \"discrimination in hiring, staffing, promotion, and retention/termination decisions.\"\n\"TSMC routinely subjects non-East Asians (including those who are not of Taiwanese or Chinese descent) to a hostile work environment where verbal abuse, gaslighting, isolation, and humiliation is common, and oftentimes leads to the constructive discharge of these employees,\" the complaint said.\nThe plaintiffs claimed executives in TSMC's U.S. facilities often lashed out and shouted at them in public just because they were Americans, saying they were described as \"lazy\" and \"stupid.\"\nTSMC has denied the accusations.\nAccompanied by her lawyer Daniel Kotchen, Howington appeared at Tuesday's hearing and told reporters outside the hearing that any multinational enterprise should abide by U.S. laws.\nHowington said TSMC is a \"widely respected and successful\" company and many Americans are grateful to the company's commitment to the U.S., and she hoped TSMC's efforts in the U.S. will succeed.\nBut the company should achieve success by observing American laws.\n\"We've all experienced significant challenges related to discrimination, and we sincerely hope that they'll be addressed in an appropriate manner,\" Howington said.\nDuring the hearing, Kotchen said the additional 15 plaintiffs would provide extra critical evidence to prove TSMC's systematic discriminatory practices in the case, and their participation would help the case proceed in favor of the plaintiffs.\nThe lawyer said that at a time when TSMC has announced an additional US$100 billion in investments in Arizona, the company needed to improve its hostile working environment.\nIn response, TSMC lawyer Fletcher Alford said at the hearing that it was inappropriate for 15 plaintiffs from Arizona to file suit against an Arizona employer in California.\nAt the same time, the case has proceeded for over seven months and that both sides wanted to expedite the trial, especially with TSMC set to expand its investment in North America.\nGiven that, Alford said it was hard to see how increasing the class action suit would accelerate the case, and he urged the court not to grant the motion to add plaintiffs.\nJudge Virginia DeMarchi said the case was challenging because new plaintiffs wanted to join the class action but were also filing individual claims.\nThough TSMC was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday's hearing, the company defended its employment practices in a statement in November 2024 after the refiling of the complaint.\n\"TSMC believes strongly in the value of a diverse workforce and we hire and promote without regard to gender, religion, race, nationality, or political affiliation because we respect differences, and believe that equal employment opportunities strengthen our competitiveness,\" it said."

However, memory chip supplier Nanya Technology Corp. and IC packaging and testing services provider shed 10 percent, the maximum daily decline, to close at NT$30.20 and NT$115.00, respectively.iPhone assembler and artificial intelligence maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market value, plunged 10 percent to end at NT$112.50, marking the third consecutive session of the maximum decline.\"Hon Hai has a broad production base in China so many investors fear the company will be hit hard by the escalating tariff war,\" Tang said.Non-tech stocksTang said select non-tech stocks also benefited from support from government-led funds throughout the session or they would have reported heavier losses.Among them, food brand Uni-President Enterprises Corp. lost 4.21 percent to close at NT$75.00, and China Steel Corp., the largest steel maker in Taiwan, shed 7.09 percent to end at NT$19.00.Elsewhere in the old economy sector, Formosa Plastics Corp. fell 9.70 percent to close at NT$31.65, and Nan Ya Plastics Corp. dropped 6.93 percent to end at NT$26.85.In the financial sector, which fell 5.61 percent, CTBC Financial Holding Co. lost 5.16 percent to close at NT$34.00, and Mega Financial Holding Co. ended down 3.66 percent at NT$36.85.

He acknowledged that it was \"quite rare\" to see Beijing name its military exercises not on their first day but on their second day.\nThe PLA's Eastern Theater Command announced on April 1 the beginning of joint exercises around Taiwan, as \"a stern warning\" to \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces.\nThe next morning, the command, which has jurisdiction over the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait, further announced that it was conducting a \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" drill in parts of the Taiwan Strait before announcing the conclusion of the two-day joint combat exercises hours later.\nRelated NewsApril 9: PRC security threat, Taiwan Strait peace, highlighted in Japan reportApril 5: 2025 Han Kuang drills targeting China's 'gray zone' actions, invasion threat: ExpertsApril 3: Scholars note China coast guard's deeper involvement in Taiwan drillsANALYSIS/PLA propaganda aimed at Chinese people, little impact in Taiwan: Experts"

    "content": "Taipei, April 9 (CNA) A newborn baby found dead in front of a deserted residence in Budai Township, Chiayi County last week was alive when it was abandoned, while the exact cause of death is still being confirmed, prosecutors said.\nThe Chiayi District Prosecutors Office said an autopsy conducted Wednesday found the newborn boy was a live birth weighing 2.523 kilograms and did not suffer from any congenital diseases.\nThe results of a toxicology report and microscopic examination are needed to determine the cause of death, the office said.\nProsecutors said the boy's mother and her husband, who is in prison, have a 1-year-old child together, whom she had given to her parents to take care of in Budai while she went to work in southern Taiwan to support the family.\nLast July, the mother found out she was pregnant and returned to her parents' house in Budai, where she tried to conceal the pregnancy from them and did not go for any prenatal care checkups, prosecutors said.\nOn March 29, the mother gave birth to a boy, and not knowing what to do, brought him to a deserted house in the area and left him there, prosecutors said.\nAt some point after abandoning the baby, the mother came back to the house at night and found that he had died. She then cleaned him and placed him in a cardboard box in front of the house, where he was reported to the police and found on April 2.\nPolice located and arrested the mother the following day.\nAt the time, prosecutors filed a motion to detain the mother, arguing that she could try to flee and should also be placed in custody for her own safety, due to her apparent emotional instability during questioning.\nThe Chiayi District Court rejected the request, however, saying that given the mother's poor finances and \"strong bonds\" with her young daughter and parents, there is no concern that she would flee.\nThe court also said the mother had confessed during questioning and that the Code of Criminal Procedure generally prohibits detaining a mother who has given birth in the past two months unless it is absolutely necessary.\nThe court ordered her freed without bail.\nIn its statement Wednesday, the prosecutors' office said it was considering charging the mother with abandonment leading to death, a crime punishable by 7 years to life imprisonment.\nDepending a confirmation of the circumstances surrounding the boy's death, she could also possibly be charged with causing the death of a child \"under unavoidable circumstances\" immediately after birth.\nThat crime is punishable by a prison term of 6 months to 5 years, the office said."

The White House said Wednesday that the 90-day pause would allow the U.S. to create a \"bespoke\" solution for all of those countries.\nPrior to Thursday's legislative session in Taipei, Lin told reporters that Taiwan was prepared to engage in talks with the U.S. on the tariff issue.\nTrump's latest announcement of a 90-day pause would give both sides more time to prepare for a \"deeper, more thorough\" bilateral negotiations on the issue, he said.\nOn Wednesday, Lin said that Taipei was in contact with the U.S., which has \"officially acknowledged our outreach.\"\n\"Taiwan has been included on the list for upcoming trade talks,\" he said, without elaborating.\nLin did not provide a timeline for the negotiations but said that the two sides had been exchanging information, with the U.S. requesting additional data from Taiwan, which the government was in the process of providing."

    "content": "Taipei, April 10 (CNA) Taiwan will rapidly expand procurement of American goods and arms and remove its barriers to free trade, President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) wrote in an opinion piece Thursday, in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's massive tariffs measures that have roiled global markets.\nIn the opinion piece titled \"Taiwan has a roadmap for deeper U.S. trade ties,\" Lai laid out a four-point core plan for Taiwan's response to Trump's tariffs.\nHours after the \"reciprocal\" tariffs went into effect Wednesday night, Trump said he was authorizing a 90-day pause but would maintain a baseline universal tariff of 10 percent for most countries, with immediate effect. The exception was China, he said, announcing an increased tariff of 125 percent on that country.\nIn Lai's opinion piece published by Bloomberg early Thursday morning (Taiwan time), he said that first, like other nations, Taiwan will engage in trade negotiations with the U.S. about tariffs.\n\"While Taiwan already maintains low tariffs, with an average nominal rate of 6%, we are willing to further cut this rate to zero on the basis of reciprocity with the US,\" he wrote. \"By removing the last vestiges to free and fair trade, we seek to encourage greater trade and investment flows between our two economies.\"\nTaiwan will also try to narrow the trade imbalance by \"rapidly\" procuring energy, agriculture and other industrial goods from the U.S., Lai said.\nMoreover, Taiwan will pursue additional arms procurement, which are vital to its self-defense against Chinese threats, he said, noting that those purchases are not reflected in trade balances.\nThirdly, Lai wrote, Taiwan will establish a cross-agency called the \"U.S. Investment Team\" to facilitate more investments in the U.S., where Taiwan firms, including power chipmaker TSMC, currently support 400,000 jobs throughout all 50 states.\nThe final core principle will see Taiwan removing barriers to free trade, Lai said, adding that his administration will address U.S. concerns about \"export controls and improper transshipment of low-cost good through Taiwan.\"\n\"These steps form the basis of a comprehensive roadmap for how Taiwan will navigate the shifting trade landscape, transforming challenges in the Taiwan-US economic relationship into new opportunities for growth, resilience and strategic alignment,\" Lai wrote.\n\"At a time of heightened global uncertainty, underpinned by growing Chinese assertiveness, closer trade ties are more than sound economics; they are a critical pillar of regional security,\" he said.\nHours after the publication of Lai's piece, when Trump abruptly announced the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, his administration said that most nations, including Taiwan, has started to negotiate trade measures with the U.S.\nOn Wednesday, Lai, who concurrently serves as chairperson of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said in a DPP central standing committee meeting that it was imperative for Taiwan to work with the Global North countries and democracies, including the U.S., to achieve better economic global outreach and to move further away from China's economic influence."

Sun and his wife were initially given jail terms of 19 years and six months, and 20 years and six months, respectively.\nThe couple were found to be connected to a case involving retired Air Force colonel Liu Sheng-shu (劉聖恕).\nBased on an investigation by prosecutors, Liu Sheng-shu began doing business in China after retiring from the Air Force in 2013.\nHe was then recruited by the Chinese side to serve as a spy and used his personal connections in the military to recruit active military officers to engage in espionage activities in exchange for monetary reward.\nLiu Sheng-shu succeeded in bringing six officers, including Sun and his wife, into his spy ring and received payments of between NT$200,000 (US$6,089) and NT$700,000 from the Chinese side through a shell company he set up for each individual recruited.\nIn addition, Liu Sheng-shu was given bonuses of between NT$30,000 and NT$100,000 when his handlers passed on classified information on Taiwan's military.\nThe retired Air Force colonel and six other officers were subsequently arrested and indicted by prosecutors in April 2023.\nFollowing subsequent rulings and appeals, the Supreme Court in June last year upheld most of the defendants' sentences except for Sun and his wife, as their verdicts were ordered to be retried by the Taiwan High Court branch in Kaohsiung.\nAccording to the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest government supervisory body, the Ministry of National Defense has also been censured over its handling of the incident, which at the time involved six active military personnel, the most in recent years."

    "content": "Taipei, April 10 (CNA) The only way to deal with tariffs imposed by the \"unpredictable\" U.S. President Donald Trump is to talk reasonably with him, the governor of Taiwan's central bank said Thursday.\nHours after the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs went into effect Wednesday, Trump said he was authorizing a 90-day pause but would maintain a baseline universal tariff of 10 percent for most countries, with immediate effect. The exception was China, he said, announcing an increased tariff of 125 percent on that country.\nOn Thursday, Governor Yang Chin-long (楊金龍) told a legislative committee meeting on the economic impact of Trump's tariffs and Taiwan's response measures that Trump's policy U-turn may have been prompted by U.S. stocks plummeting shortly after the tariffs took effect.\nTrump's announcement of a temporary pause sent U.S. markets soaring overnight, with Taiwan shares also surging more than 1,600 points Thursday.\nDuring the legislative session, Kuomintang Legislator Lin Te-fu (林德福) said that even though Taiwan is among the countries listed by Trump for the 90-day pause of his \"reciprocal\" tariffs, he had announced a 32 percent tariff on imports from Taiwan.\nLin asked whether this meant that \"the U.S. is taking advantage of Taiwan.\"\nIn response, Yang explained that the formula used by the U.S. to calculate reciprocal tariffs is unreasonable and too rough, but it is aimed at the whole world and applies to all countries, not just Taiwan.\nAsked about how Taiwan would respond to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Yang said that Trump did not take into account the fact that Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. was because of his country's need for Taiwan's products.\nTaiwan has contributed to the U.S.' productivity and economy, Yang added.\nOn the issue of reciprocal tariffs, Yang said that if all countries start talking about it with the U.S., it should be more effective to achieve \"reciprocity.\"\nHowever, Yang said that given that the uncertainty caused by Trump on Taiwan's financial markets is too high, \"the only way is to have a reasonable talk with him (Trump).\"\nIf uncertain factors can be eliminated, a stable return in Taiwan's equity market can be expected, he said.\nYang said a suggestion from legislators that Taiwan's central bank use its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities as a bargaining chip was a \"good idea.\"\nIf Taiwan embarks on such negotiations with the U.S., it should tell the other party that while the U.S. has to issue government bonds to finance its deficits, Taiwan's long-term holding of U.S. Treasuries will help lower its financial costs, Yang added.\nAsked whether Taiwan's benchmark Taiex index will enter a bear market due to Trump's tariffs policy, Yang admitted that at present, the uncertainty in the stock market is quite high.\nHowever, Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Peng Jin-lung (彭金隆) said that it certainly has not entered a bear market and there is no systemic risk in the market.\nMeanwhile, Finance Minister Chuang Tsui-yun (莊翠雲) said during the legislative session that the ministry has assessed whether to increase the authorized amount of NT$500 billion (US$15.16 billion) in the National Financial Stabilization Fund for an intervention in the stock market to ease volatility.\nAt another legislative committee meeting, Economics Minister Kuo Jyh-huei (郭智輝) said that the government is set to make an announcement on April 14 on bailouts for businesses to counter new U.S. tariffs."

The CWA advised people heading outdoors in the afternoon to be prepared for possible rainfall.\nAlso on Friday, independent meteorologist Wu Der-rong (吳德榮) forecast partly cloudy skies across Taiwan until Saturday afternoon.\nAccording to Wu, thunderstorms and intermittent rain could affect much of Taiwan from Saturday evening through Sunday morning as a weather front moves across the island.\nThe weather is expected to turn fair again on Sunday, he said."

Prosecutors requested a total sentence of 28 years and six months.\nAccording to prosecutors, Ko allegedly entrusted bribes he took to Hsu after receiving them.\nAfter returning to Taiwan from an overseas trip on Aug. 27 last year, Hsu, acting under Ko's instructions, quickly booked a flight at 4:10 a.m. on Aug. 29, and departed for Japan that same day, prosecutors have said.\nTaipei prosecutors said that after failing to secure Hsu's return through her friends, they issued a warrant for her arrest based on the law because she \"ignored a legal summons without valid reason and could not be located for arrest.\"\nThe Bureau of Consular Affairs under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been also asked to cancel Hsu's passport, and a request for extradition has been made through judicial cooperation channels, prosecutors said.\nThe Investigation Bureau emphasized that efforts to track Hsu's whereabouts are ongoing, saying that legal attachés posted abroad will seek judicial assistance from countries Hsu may have traveled through."

Their presence may have helped build support for the team, as the Guardians saw ticket sales for the team's two-game season opening series surge by 30 percent compared to the 2024 season, the franchise said.\nLee signed with Fubon in January, becoming the first cheerleader to join a Taiwanese franchise under an exclusive management contract. The deal was described by the agency at her March press conference as \"a milestone in Taiwan's baseball industry.\"\nIt had been rumored that Lee's contract was worth at least NT$10 million (US$304,925), though Fubon Sports & Entertainment President Joyce Chen (陳昭如) denied the figure without disclosing the actual amount.\nNow 20, Lee began her cheerleading career in 2023 and shot to fame in 2024 while cheering for the KBO's Kia Tigers.\nA viral video featuring her that garnered over 93 million views on YouTube showed her touching up her makeup courtside before standing up calmly to perform the so-called \"strikeout dance\" as the music began.\nLee and several other Kia Tigers cheerleaders were invited to Taiwan by Fubon in July 2024 to cheer for the Guardians during a special weekend series at Taipei Dome.\nSince then, Taiwanese fans have called on CPBL teams to recruit her, as more and more South Korean cheerleaders gain popularity in the league.\nLee is not the first South Korean cheerleader to join a CPBL squad while continuing to work in South Korea.\nLee Da-hye, who blazed the trail for Korean cheerleaders in the CPBL, frequently traveled between the two countries during her first season with the Rakuten Monkeys in 2023.\nHer success both on the field and in commercial endorsements marked a new era, encouraging more Korean cheerleaders to pursue careers in Taiwan, where cheerleaders enjoy as much -- if not more -- exposure as the players do.\nIn May 2024, Lee Da-hye announced she had rented a home in Taiwan and did not rule out buying property."

The Cabinet said on Thursday the government would notify the public of progress in due course.\nFriday's meeting followed two previous discussions Lai had with representatives from information and communications technology, non-tech industries and small and medium-sized enterprises at the presidential residence last weekend.\nThe meeting moved behind closed doors after Lai and Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry (TAMI) Chairman David Chuang (莊大立) delivered their remarks.\nChuang expressed concern that the 32 percent duties Taiwan was set to face before they were postponed would not only directly impact Taiwanese machinery exports to the U.S. but also undermine their global competitiveness.\nTAMI issued a statement on Thursday urging the government to negotiate with the U.S. for a lower tariff rate for Taiwanese machinery products, particularly for a rate lower than their main competitors from Japan and South Korea.\nThe association, which represents more than 2,700 company members in Taiwan, also called for \"interest-free loans\" for machinery businesses that had already begun to feel the sting of the tariffs.\nTrump's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on imports from dozens of countries -- including a blanket 32 percent levy on most Taiwanese goods -- were scheduled to take effect on Wednesday.\nOn Wednesday afternoon (Washington time), however, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the new measures, with reduced 10 percent duties to be applied instead to all countries but China.\nChuang said companies in the machinery business will work with the government to address the ills of transshipments, a practice where goods are routed through a third country to alter their country of origin to benefit from lower duties imposed on that third country.\nAt the same time, Chuang continued, Taiwanese suppliers are willing to collaborate with American partners in manufacturing machine tools, adding that \"we will be a good partner.\""

It is currently at 66 percent.\nThe Ministry of Civil Services have said the new measures would increase the financial burden facing the public service pension system, which is already strained by decreased revenues.\nThe system is expected to have an estimated shortfall of NT$170 billion (US$5.18 billion) over the next 50 years and this amount will eventually fall on all taxpayers, the ministry said in January.\nOpposition lawmakers argued, however, that pension plans for law enforcement and emergency services personnel should be adjusted to levels comparable to those for military personnel, citing the high pressure they face due to high-risk duties and long, rotating work hours.\nTPP lawmaker Chang Chi-kai (張啓楷) said ahead of the revote that the high-risk nature of police and firefighting work results in an average life expectancy five to 10 years shorter than that of the general population.\nChang criticized the DPP government for failing to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of these officers and firefighters.\nFriday's vote marked the Cabinet's sixth failed attempt to reject legislation which it had opposed after being passed by the opposition-led Legislature over the past 10 months.\nThe executive body may -- with the president's approval -- request a legislative revote on legislation lawmakers have passed, if it considers such a law \"difficult to implement,\" as per Article 3-2 of the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China.\nFor the legislation to be upheld, more than half of all lawmakers -- or 57 votes in the current Legislature -- must vote in favor in a revote, or that law will be annulled automatically."

However, these numbers remained largely unchanged from the previous year, pointing to a global slowdown in population growth, the agency added."

    "content": "Washington, April 10 (CNA) A U.S. think tank suggested, in a recent report, Taiwan boost defense spending to meet its needs given the threat from China and that the U.S. ensure timely delivery of essential military capabilities.\nGlobal Taiwan Institute (GTI), based in Washington D.C., released \"U.S.-Taiwan Relations: Advancing Four Pillars of the Strategic Partnership,\" to mark the 46th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act, which set the foundation for continued ties between the U.S. and Taiwan following the former severing diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1979.\nThe report assessed how the strategic partnership has evolved across four key pillars -- security, international space, economic ties, and people-to-people relations -- and offered forward-looking policy recommendations to sustain peace and stability amid rising challenges from China.\nIn terms of national defense and security, the GTI suggested that Taiwan should increase its defense budget to enable procurement of capabilities necessary to secure its national defense and sustainment needs against a full range of attack from China and coercion scenarios.\nHowever, the report noted that the exact percentage of GDP assigned to that task is less important than Taipei demonstrating the will and ability to respond effectively to the complex and evolving Chinese threat.\nOn the U.S. side, the GTI suggested Washington strengthen its defense industrial base to enable more timely provision of essential military capabilities to Taiwan and help enhance the island's own indigenous defense industrial capacity.\nThe GTI urged the U.S. to improve joint planning and training with Taiwan to counter military, coercive, and gray zone threats, ensuring the island's defense and resilience.\nTaiwan's military and citizenry in turn must invest more seriously in such preparations, the GTI added in the report.\nMeanwhile, at a forum held on Thursday in Washington D.C. to launch the report, Brent Christensen, former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, dismissed the idea of Taiwan spending around 10 percent of its GDP on defense as unrealistic.\nThe idea that Taiwan should raise its defense spending to around 10 percent of GDP was most recently mentioned by Elbridge Colby during a Senate confirmation hearing in early March.\n\"I agree with President Trump that they should be more like 10 percent, or at least something in that ballpark, really focused on their defense,\" said Colby, who was confirmed as U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy early this week.\nIn contrast to Colby, Christensen argued that it is not necessary to get too fixated on what percentage of GDP is being spent on defense.\nTaiwan's defense spending, as a percentage of GDP, likely underrepresents broader investments in civil defense and societal resilience, which are integral to the overall defense strategy that Taiwan is adopting, said Christensen, a co-author of the report.\nTaiwan's Cabinet earmarked NT$647 billion (US$20.02 billion) for defense spending in 2025, equal to 2.45 percent of GDP, some of which was later cut or frozen by the opposition-controlled Legislature.\nThe Ministry of National Defense reported in early March that NT$8 billion from this year's defense budget had been cut, with an additional NT$90 billion frozen.\nPresident Lai Ching-te (賴清德) later pledged to propose a special budget to raise defense spending to over 3 percent of GDP, though that, too, would require legislative approval."

    "date": "2025-04-11",
    "content": "Taipei, April 11 (CNA) The 32 percent import duty U.S. President Donald Trump announced last week for Taiwan is considered \"extremely high\" by Taiwan's government, which has proposed a NT$88 billion (US$2.72 billion) support package for the worst-case scenario, Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) said Friday.\nIn a special report presented to lawmakers in Taipei Friday, Cho said Trump's 32 percent \"reciprocal tariffs\" announced on April 2 for Taiwan is \"extremely high\" and would have the most significant impact of the three scenarios for which the government had drafted responses.\nThe three scenarios are based on the U.S. tariff rates Taiwan could face, and 30 percent or higher is described as \"extremely high,\" according to Cho.\nThe \"reciprocal tariffs\" announced for dozens of countries the U.S. has trade deficit with were scheduled to take effect on Wednesday, but the U.S. president announced a 90-day pause on the new measures, while retaining the 10 percent duties imposed last Saturday on nearly all countries and territories.\nThe 32 percent tariffs announced for Taiwan is higher than the 24 percent duty set for Japan and the 25 percent levy for South Korea.\nAt that level, Taiwan is expected to see a drop of at least 21 percent in the value of goods shipped to the United States, as American buyers are expected to see higher pricing of products sent from Taiwan due to the higher costs created by the import duty.\nTo prevent American clients from placing orders with competitors in other countries, Taiwanese businesses will have to consider moving manufacturing to locations outside Taiwan in order to stay competitive in the global market, Cho said.\nThe local manufacturing sector is likely to see a 5 percent drop in production value, and 125,000 jobs could be at stake, the premier said.\nThe agricultural sector will also be hit by the sweeping tariff at 32 percent, because of the added cost of exporting products to the U.S., which are estimated at NT$320 million for orchids, NT$460 million for tilapia, and NT$110 million for mahi mahi, or dolphin fish, Cho said.\nCho made the presentation to obtain lawmakers' support for the administration's NT$88 billion proposal aimed at mitigating the impact over a four-year period.\nThe support plans will be funded through a special budget and therefore require legislative approval.\nIn the scenario of Taiwan facing \"low\" U.S. tariff of 10-20 percent, Cho said the impact on local industries are expected to be manageable and the four-year support plan would cost NT$36.1 billion.\nThe \"high\" U.S. tariffs at 20-30 percent in the government's projections show higher risk of impacting certain manufacturing sectors, such as machinery and electronics, as well as exports of agricultural and fishery products, with the cost of the support plans estimated at NT$57.6 billion, according to Cho.\nIn addition to the proposed plans, Cho said Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun (鄭麗君) will lead trade negotiations with the U.S. to address Washington's concerns over trade barriers.\nThe government will also tackle other trade issues raised by Washington, including export controls on advanced technology and Chinese products \"dumped\" on the U.S. market through a third country like Taiwan and Vietnam, the premier said.\nAs the U.S. has imposed \"reciprocal tariffs\" of 145 percent on China, Cho said the government will also prevent China from \"dumping\" cheap products in markets outside the U.S., including Taiwan."

    "content": "Taipei, April 11 (CNA) Taiwanese food conglomerate DaChan Great Wall Group plans to expand its footprint in the U.S. processed food market and introduce signature Taiwanese dishes such as beef noodles, the company said at an investor conference on Friday.\nFollowing its acquisition of a majority stake in U.S.-based processed food maker Amy Food Inc. last year, DaChan plans to build two new processing plants in the United States, with construction expected to begin later this year, according to its chairman Han Chia-yu (韓家宇).\nThe new facilities will significantly boost production capacity, scaling up existing product lines such as spring rolls and dumplings, while adding traditional Taiwanese favorites like beef noodle soup to its offerings, Han said.\nPresident Han Fang-hao (韓芳豪) noted that the acquisition of Amy Food was a strategic move to expand DaChan's presence in the U.S.\nAmy Food already has strong distribution channels, selling to high school and university cafeterias as well as major supermarkets across the country, he said, adding that DaChan aims to further grow these operations using its own management capabilities.\nWhen asked about the impact of U.S. tariff policies, Chairman Han said the group's Indonesian facility -- responsible for seafood processing and generating about 15 percent of its revenue from U.S. exports -- may be the most affected.\nMeanwhile, DaChan's China operations mainly serve the local market and export only minimally to Japan, without shipping to the U.S., suggesting that overall tariff impacts will be limited.\nLooking ahead, he said DaChan is moving forward with several major investments.\nIn Taiwan, new facilities for aquaculture feed, native chicken processing, white meat chicken portioning, and biotech manufacturing are expected to come online this year and start contributing to revenue in the second half.\nIn addition, expansion of the company's pig farm operations in Vietnam and seafood processing plant in Indonesia will also be completed in 2025, providing further operational momentum.\nIn 2024, DaChan posted consolidated revenue of NT$102.75 billion (US$3.16 billion), a year-on-year decrease of 7.52 percent."

    "content": "Taipei, April 12 (CNA) Taiwan and the United States will hold additional talks on tariffs after representatives of both sides held their first meeting on Friday U.S. time, according to the Office of Trade Negotiations under Taiwan's Executive Yuan.\nThe office confirmed on Saturday Taipei time that the negotiation teams from Taiwan and the U.S. talked with each other via a teleconference, saying the two sides exchanged views on reciprocal tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and other issues such as non-tariff trade barriers and export controls.\nThe office did not disclose other details about the negotiations, citing a mutual tacit understanding, but said the two sides will hold further talks in the near future.\nOn Friday, President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) said Taiwan was among the first group of countries to enter into tariff negotiations with the U.S. on the Trump administration's latest tariff announcement, which has sent ripples through the global financial markets.\nOn April 2 U.S. time, Trump announced sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" on U.S. trading partners, including a 32 percent tax on Taiwanese goods that was set to take effect on Wednesday.\nTrump had also declared a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries starting April 5. Countries with larger trade surpluses with the United States would face higher duties beginning Wednesday, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (25 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (37 percent).\nOn Wednesday afternoon U.S. time, however, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the new measures, with reduced 10 percent duties to be applied instead to all countries except China.\nLai has said Taiwan has no intention of launching retaliatory measures to counter the U.S. tariffs, and sought to enter negotiations with the Trump administration with a goal of \"zero tariffs,\" modeled after the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\nLai acknowledged the \"significant impact\" that the 32 percent tariff would have on Taiwan's economy, but urged the public not to panic, citing Taiwan's strong economic fundamentals.\nAs for non-tariff barriers, Taiwan remains on the latest U.S. list of trading partners with trade barriers, according to a report released by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on March 31, two days before Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement.\nThe report raised concerns over Taiwan's tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., as well as non-tariff barriers, technical trade barriers, measures on animal and plant quarantine, intellectual property rights protection, the service sector and investments, among other barriers.\nAccording to Lai, although 23.4 percent of Taiwan's exports went to the U.S. in 2024, more than 75 percent were shipped to other markets.\nHe said among the goods exported to the U.S., competitive information and communication technology (ICT) products and electronic components made up 65.4 percent -- a sign that Taiwan's economy remains highly resilient, riding waves of strength of advanced tech items."

    "content": "Hanoi, April 12 (CNA) Taiwanese businesses in Vietnam are exploring alternatives after the United States imposed a 46 percent import duty on Vietnamese goods, following President Donald Trump's announcement of \"reciprocal\" tariffs on America's trading partners.\nLo Shih-liang (羅世良), chairman of Brico Industry Co., Ltd., a Taiwanese company that manufactures cast iron cookware and stove components in Vietnam, said over 40 percent of his business was tied to the U.S. market, describing the constant U.S. policy shifts as an emotional roller coaster ride in a recent interview with CNA.\n\"I work during the day and stay up all night watching the news. I've been following U.S. news until 3 or 4 a.m.,\" said Lo with a wry smile.\nUp until recently, Lo was deeply worried about the 46 percent tariff on Vietnam announced by Trump on April 2 -- one of the highest rates among the dozens of targeted countries.\nHowever, he told CNA he now feels somewhat relieved -- though not entirely at ease -- after the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on Wednesday (Washington time) for nearly all of the targeted countries, including Vietnam but excluding China.\nSharing the same emotional turmoil is Sun Chi-an (孫其安), the general manager of a factory in Vietnam's Bắc Ninh Province operated by Johnson Health Tech. Co., Ltd., a Taiwanese company that manufactures fitness equipment.\nSun said he has had trouble sleeping, adding, \"I've been watching CNN every night to keep track of any tariff changes.\"\nTo Sun, the 46 percent tariff came as a surprise, given that U.S.-Vietnam relations appeared to be on good terms.\nIn the face of uncertainty, he said the company does not want to make major adjustments that could affect the stability of production quality, especially as customer demand remains.\nAs a result, production and raw material preparation in his company are continuing as scheduled, and efforts are being made to retain factory manpower, Sun added.\nAlthough upcoming negotiations between Hanoi and Washington may lead to lower tariffs, Sun said it was unlikely that the \"reciprocal\" tariff will be fully lifted, meaning his company's production costs will inevitably rise.\nHe said his company plans to discuss cost-sharing with suppliers and assess competitors' strategies, with the latter move aiming to offset the impact of the tariffs by passing some of the additional costs to consumers.\nSun said the \"reciprocal\" tariffs also present an opportunity, as most of Johnson's competitors rely heavily on supply chains in China, and the tariff on Vietnam, though expected to remain high after negotiations, will likely be lower than the rate imposed on China.\nAs of Saturday, the U.S. imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145% on all imports from China.\nMeanwhile, Lo said Brico is using the 90-day window to coordinate with clients, suggesting they take stock, assess their inventory, or place orders early so shipments can reach the U.S. within the pause period.\nHe added that transferring goods to the company's warehouses in Mexico could also be an option, which would provide greater flexibility.\nLo said the company previously focused on developed countries with strong consumer purchasing power, but its long-term market strategy is shifting.\nBrico is now targeting mid-tier markets in regions such as the Middle East and Europe, aiming to reduce its reliance on the U.S. market from 45 percent to around 30 percent, he added."

As a result, Taiwanese PCB makers could become very cautious about expanding in the Southeast Asian country, where 14 Taiwanese firms run production bases, he said.\nLi is a senior advisor to Taiwan-based Ajinomoto build-up film (ABF) supplier Unimicron Technology Corp.\nIn addition to Unimicron, another 13 Taiwanese PCB firms have investments in Thailand, making the country Taiwan's major overseas manufacturing hub for PCBs, which are used in many electronic products. These Taiwanese companies include Compeq Manufacturing Co., ZhGolen Ding Technology Holding Ltd., and Gold Circuit Electronics Ltd.\nTripod Technology Corp. has built facilities in Vietnam while HannStar Board Corp. and Global Brands Manufacturer Ltd. run production lines in Malaysia.\nLi made the comments after the Trump administration announced a fresh round of tariffs on April 2 U.S. time.\nTrump declared a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries starting April 5. Countries with larger trade surpluses with the United States would face higher duties beginning April 9, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (25 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (37 percent).\nOn Wednesday afternoon U.S. time, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the new measures, with reduced 10 percent duties to be applied instead to all countries but China.\nLi said he was surprised that the Trump administration imposed higher tariffs on Thailand and Vietnam than on Taiwan, adding that Trump's move poses a challenge to Taiwanese PCB makers, particularly those manufacturing in Thailand.\nLi said these Taiwanese PCB makers went to Thailand to extend their global footprints since their clients requested them to do so to avoid the impact of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.\nHowever, Li said, they now encounter a bigger headache from the Trump administration's latest tariff actions, and they are expected to slow down their efforts to manufacture in Thailand products sold to the U.S. market.\nMeanwhile, the tariff war between Washington and Beijing remains a top issue for Taiwanese PCB producers, Li said, as they have built sprawling production lines in China. Trump has hiked duties on goods made in China to 145 percent, while China hit back by raising tariffs on American merchandise to 125 percent.\nLi suggested that Taiwanese PCB producers should reconsider what would be a better strategy regarding their investments in China, suggesting that their facilities in the Chinese market should sell their goods in China instead of exporting them.\nAs for Trump's calls to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., Li said it was not easy for Taiwanese PCB suppliers to relocate their investments to the U.S. market, because it lacks a comprehensive supply chain and has higher labor costs, adding that production in the U.S. could become a heavier financial burden than tariffs to many of these Taiwanese firms.\nChiu Shih-fang (邱昰芳), an analyst with the Taiwan Industry Economic Services under the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said that compared with tech gadget assemblers, component makers like PCB suppliers are expected to encounter higher barriers to producing in the U.S. market.\nChiu said she has deeper concerns about end-user demand for products such as electric vehicles, servers, notebook computers, and smartphones containing PCBs, as the desire for such goods is expected to be hit by higher product prices caused by tariff hikes.\nShe said once end-user demand weakens, demand for PCBs could be affected accordingly. In addition, if their clients ask them to share higher costs from tariff hikes, these PCB firms could face additional financial risks."

Or maybe they would be able to send a message using the store's emergency hotspot,\" said the report.\nThe Guardian article said that the idea was being discussed by the committee created by President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) to make Taiwanese society more resilient in the event of an attack or natural disaster.\nIn response to the report, Presidential Office spokesperson Karen Kuo (郭雅慧) told CNA that the idea of turning civilian distributors into emergency hubs had been brought up by retail industry representatives during a round of meetings held by the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee.\nThese representatives shared how they supported the public after the 921 earthquake struck central Taiwan in 1999, according to Kuo.\nKuo said that although this was useful information for the government, the Lai administration has not actually begun making the type of plans mentioned in the Guardian report and other media reports.\nIn fact, the government has an existing plan for setting up wartime distribution stations to distribute \"strategic materials,\" the spokesperson said.\nShe also denied that Taiwan's police \"will be sent to frontlines\" during a Chinese invasion, as the Guardian report suggested might happen.\nThe Guardian said: \"No one knows for sure what a Chinese attack on Taiwan will look like, but there are some assumptions made by government planners.\n\"They expect Taiwan's military and maybe police will be sent to frontlines, leaving civilian first responders in charge of care and control.\"\nKuo emphasized that the nation's police will be responsible for maintaining social order and logistics and safeguarding key infrastructure during wartime, but will not be sent to the frontline.\nThe Presidential Office formed the advisory group, Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, in June 2024.\nThe committee has pledged to enhance Taiwan's resilience by training civilian forces, securing strategic and critical supplies, reinforcing energy and key infrastructure, and ensuring the continued operations of medical, transportation, information and financial facilities.\nThe committee has so far held three rounds of meetings, most recently on March 27 during a civil defense drill in Tainan."

    "content": "Taipei, April 13 (CNA) The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Sunday expelled a former assistant of Joseph Wu (吳釗燮), Taiwan's current national security chief and former foreign minister, from the party over the former's alleged involvement in a Chinese espionage case.\nThe DPP's headquarters in Yilan County announced the expulsion following an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss the case involving Ho Jen-chieh (何仁傑), who worked for Wu during his tenure as Taiwan's top diplomat between 2018 and 2024.\nChiu Chia-chin (邱嘉進), head of the DPP's Yilan headquarters, said the decision was unanimous, citing Ho's alleged actions as severely damaging to the party's reputation and \"running counter to the DPP's core values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\"\nTaipei prosecutors detained Ho on Thursday after searching his residence.\nHo's arrest adds to a growing list of individuals suspected of spying for Chinese intelligence services while working for senior DPP government officials, which has been in power since 2016.\nOther suspects in the case include Wu Shang-yu (吳尚雨), who worked as an adviser in President Lai Ching-te's (賴清德) office; Chiu Shih-yuan (邱世元), former deputy head of the DPP's Taiwan Institute of Democracy, and Huang Chu-jung (黃取榮), assistant to DPP New Taipei Councilor Lee Yu-tien (李余典).\nAccording to the prosecutors, Huang is believed to have been recruited by Beijing's intelligence services while doing business in China.\nProsecutors allege that after returning to Taiwan, Huang started working with Ho, Wu Shang-yu and Chiu to gather confidential information about Lai and other top officials.\nAccording to a Chinese-language Liberty Times report on Sunday, Wu first hired Ho when he began his tenure as National Security Council (NSC) secretary-general under then President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) in May 2016.\nBefore recruitment, Ho cleared background and security checks conducted by the National Security Bureau and the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau.\nHowever, as Ho was not vetted further following the initial check, he did not have permission to access more confidential information, the report said.\nHo later followed Wu to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) when Wu took up the post as the nation's top diplomat in February 2018.\nAccording to MOFA, Ho left the job as Wu's assistant in March 2024, two months before Wu left his foreign minister post to become NSC secretary-general again under Tsai's successor, President Lai Ching-te (賴清德).\nThe Liberty Times quoted unnamed sources familiar with the matter as saying the case of Ho exposed a loophole in the government's background and security check system that should be addressed.\nWhen asked for comment, MOFA told CNA on Sunday that a standard background and security check was conducted on Ho before he was hired as a contract-based assistant to then-Foreign Minister Wu.\nHowever, Ho did not have to go through more in-depth higher-level background and security vetting, which is compulsory for all high-level diplomats, MOFA said in a statement.\nMOFA added that it also conducts regular checks of all staff, including contract-based workers, in accordance with the Public Functionaries Merit Evaluation Act and related ministry regulations."

    "content": "Taipei, April 13 (CNA) The Cabinet has postponed by a week the release of details of a NT$88 billion (US$2.72 billion) support package aimed at mitigating the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on Taiwan's economy, Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) said.\nCho announced the delay during a meeting with edamame producers and traders in Pingtung County on Sunday, the fourth stop on his \"industry listening tour.\"\nDue to uncertainty surrounding the U.S. position, Cho said ministries and agencies need more time to finalize the package's details, including how subsidies will be allocated across various industries.\nOfficials in Washington and Taipei began talks via video conferencing on Friday regarding the \"reciprocal tariffs\" announced on April 2 by U.S. President Donald Trump, who plans to hike import duties on goods from more than 70 countries, including Taiwan.\nA 10 percent global levy has been imposed on almost all goods shipped to the U.S. from April 5, but more than 70 countries were set to see the higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" slapped on their U.S.-bound goods from April 9, until Trump announced a 90-day pause on the higher import tax.\nThe \"reciprocal tariffs\" announced for Taiwan are set at 32 percent, higher than neighboring economies, including the 24 percent import duties set for Japan, and the 25 percent planned for South Korea.\nChina was the only country that saw Trump's \"reciprocal tariffs\" take effect on April 9 at 125 percent, on top of an existing 20 percent Trump imposed, citing fentanyl.\nDuring the Pingtung meeting, Wei Dong-qi (魏東啓), chairperson of the Taiwan Regional Association of Frozen Vegetable and Fruit Manufacturers, raised concerns about China overtaking Taiwan as Japan's top edamame supplier last year, citing local production losses caused by typhoons.\nWei said he was worried Chinese producers would further shift their focus to Japan, given the newly imposed 125 percent U.S. tariff, which could further hurt Taiwan's share in that market.\nChen Jung-hua (陳榮華), head of an association of contract edamame producers, urged the government to negotiate lower rents on leased farmland and offer subsidies to offset the rising costs of fertilizer, equipment, and harvest labor.\nAccording to the Agriculture and Food Agency, Taiwan produced 77,258 metric tons of edamame in 2024, with 45 percent exported. Japan accounted for 73 percent of the 32,654 metric tons sold overseas, followed by the United States at 19 percent.\nThe agency said the U.S. imports around 40,000 metric tons of frozen edamame annually, with 70 percent coming from China and 10-15 percent from Taiwan.\nDespite the new tariffs, Chinese edamame could still undercut Taiwanese prices in the U.S. market due to significantly lower production costs, the agency said.\nDuring his briefing to lawmakers on Friday, Cho said edamame was among the agricultural products most vulnerable to the 32 percent tariff. He noted that funding and special legislation for the four-year support package still require legislative approval."

We can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us,\" Lutnick told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.\nIn addition, U.S. President Donald Trump said on the Truth platform that his administration will take a look at semiconductors and the entire electronics supply chain in an upcoming National Security Tariff Investigation and \"we will not be held hostage by other countries, especially hostile trading nations like China.\"\nUnder pressure from Washington, the global electronics market will be divided into three major parts in the future: the U.S., China and the market excluding the U.S. and China, Huang said.\nAmid an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing, electronics suppliers will relocate their production to the U.S. or to other countries which face relatively low tariffs, while China will roll out its own electronics devices for the domestic market, Huang added.\nWhen electronics makers rush to invest in the U.S., Huang said, they will also speed up the pace of their investments in Mexico eyeing tariff free incentives under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Huang said.\nAs for China, Beijing will continue to encourage tech suppliers to produce in the home market, which faces export controls and high tariffs from the U.S., so any foreign firm which wants a share of the market will need to buy components and assemble their products there, he added.\nChina is expected to expedite its efforts to develop chips used in artificial intelligence applications and electric vehicles as well as high bandwidth memory chips to own its supply chain, in a bid to break export restrictions imposed by the U.S. by pursuing de-Americanization, he noted.\nOn the other hand, the U.S. will try to achieve the goal of de-Sinicization, Huang said."

    "content": "Taipei, April 14 (CNA) Researchers have learned to effectively propagate the Taiwan quillwort (Isoetes taiwanensis), a species of semi-aquatic herb that is only found near Menghuan Lake on Taipei's Yangmingshan, thus easing the immediate threat of extinction.\nThe endemic plant species, which was discovered in 1971, is only found within an area of less than 0.5 hectares around Menghuan Lake, Huang Yao-mou (黃曜謀), a researcher at the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute told CNA.\nAlthough it grows in a humid subtropical climate zone, the species has faced threats from drought and competition from other species, which almost led to its extinction in 2006, Huang said.\nIn order to help save the species, Huang said, he conducted 3-to-5-years of observation, in which he noted that the plant released spores that passed the winter in the soil before germinating the following spring.\nAccording to Huang, the cold winter temperatures play a role in activating the spores, with some germinating the following year and other taking up to 30 years.\nHuang experimented by placing soil samples with Taiwan quillwort spores in a refrigerator at 4 degrees Celsius, removing some of the samples every two weeks.\nHe found that while the plant's megaspores normally took an average of 12 weeks to germinate, exposure to sustained cold temperatures could reduce that time to as little as two weeks.\nMoreover, he found that 63 percent of the spores had germinated after 20 weeks stored at low temperatures, compared to only 26.5 percent in normal conditions.\nMore specimens also made it to later stages in the plant's life cycle, allowing them to be used for educational or research purposes and assisting in conservation efforts, Huang said.\nHuang noted that Taiwan quillworts are the first plants in the genus Isoetes to have their genome sequenced, which is useful in studying the special type of photosynthesis, called CAM photosynthesis, used by them and some terrestrial plants.\nAs Isoetes in other neighboring countries, such as China, Japan and South Korea are almost all hybrids with Taiwan quillworts, the genome data also helps scientists better understand how Isoetes evolved, Huang said.\nHuang and his team of researchers published the results of their study on the effects of cold treatment on Taiwan quillwort spore germination in the India Fern Journal last December."

    "content": "Taipei, April 14 (CNA) Shares in Taiwan closed slightly lower Monday with initial gains eroded as lingering concerns over the Trump administration's tariffs on semiconductors continued to hurt market sentiment, dealers said.\nThe Taiex, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), ended down 15.68 points, or 0.08 percent, at 19,513.09 after moving between 19,508.93 and 20,023.63. Turnover totaled NT$461.48 billion (US$14.20 billion).\nThe market opened up 0.81 percent and buying pushed the Taiex up to the day's high by about 490 points to top the 20,000 point mark in the early morning session, on the back of a rally on U.S. markets at the end of last week, dealers said.\nHowever, selling emerged, in particular in contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to send the index into negative territory as investors turned nervous about U.S. tariffs on semiconductors, dealers added.\nOn Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters that his administration will provide more information about tariffs on semiconductors on Monday, while his government has granted temporary exemptions on electronics products.\n\"Investors simply took the money and ran after trimming their holdings in TSMC as the Taiex rebounded today,\" Cathay Futures Consultant analyst Tsai Ming-han said. \"They fear Trump's tariffs on semiconductors will bomb the market.\"\n\"Without disruptions by TSMC's losses, the smaller over-the-counter market closed higher on U.S. gains,\" Tsai said. The OTC index rose 1.79 percent to end at 208.61.\nTSMC, the most heavily weighted stock on the local market, lost 2.70 percent to close at the day's low of NT$865.00. The stock's fall from the day's high cost the Taiex about 300 points, sending the electronics index down 0.51 percent.\nAmong other semiconductor stocks, IC packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. lost 1.49 percent to end at NT$132.50, while smartphone IC designer MediaTek Inc. rose 1.08 percent to close at NT$1,400.00, and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designer Alchip Technologies Inc. gained 4.94 percent to end at NT$2,230.00.\nAlso in the tech sector, shares in iPhone assembler and AI server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market value, rose 2.97 percent to close at NT$138.50, and Quanta Computer Inc., another AI server supplier, rose 5.80 percent to end at NT$228.00.\nMost large-cap non-tech stocks remained largely stable, giving additional support to the broader market, with Formosa Plastics Corp. up 1.58 percent to close at NT$35.35 and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. rising 2.03 percent to end at NT$35.10 after a spike in international crude oil prices over the weekend, Tsai said.\nIn addition, crude oil price sensitive textile brand Far Eastern New Century Corp. rose 1.54 percent to close at NT$32.90, and Eclat Textile Co. gained 5.23 percent to end at NT$372.00.\nIn the financial sector, which rose 0.22 percent, Fubon Financial Holding Co. added 0.62 percent to close at NT$80.90, and Cathay Financial Holding Co. rose 0.55 percent to end at NT$54.50.\n\"Further losses on semiconductor tariffs are possible,\" Tsai said. \"But, I expect the Taiex will see strong technical support at around 17,391 points (the day's low on April 9).\"\nAccording to the TWSE, foreign institutional investors sold a net NT$18.61 billion worth of shares on the main board Monday."

Training is set to begin in mid-January -- earlier than usual -- at Tseng's suggestion.\nIn November 2024, Tseng earned unanimous praise after leading a modest roster to victory in the WBSC Premier12, securing Taiwan's first-ever world championship in a major senior-level tournament of its national sport.\nHe was then appointed manager for the 2025 WBC Qualifiers, in which Taiwan faced Spain, Nicaragua, and South Africa in Taipei in February to vie for two tournament spots.\nThe team did not live up to its advanced billing, however, narrowly avoiding a mercy rule loss to Spain in the opener before taking revenge in a rematch to clinch the final qualifying spot.\nFollowing the qualifiers, CPBL Commissioner Tsai Chi-chang (蔡其昌) said Tseng remained the best candidate for the managerial role. Tseng, citing intense pressure, initially declined to make an immediate decision, saying he needed time to rest.\nOn March 22, he confirmed he was willing to take the job again, pending discussions with the Monkeys to strike a balance between club and national duties.\n\"This opportunity was offered by the commissioner, the league, and other officials who made our achievement possible,\" Tseng said. \"Also, all the players and coaches contributed to this honor, so yes, I'm absolutely willing to take on this mission.\"\nThe 2026 WBC will take place in early March, with Taiwan joining reigning champions Japan, along with Australia, South Korea, and the Czech Republic in Pool C.\nThe team is expected to finalize its roster in early February, the CPBL said."

    "content": "Taipei, April 15 (CNA) A key factor pushing China's bid to join a regional trade bloc that Taiwan also aspires to is to \"block Taipei's application,\" warned a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official on Tuesday.\nWith the United States rekindling a trade war with China, Beijing is now showing \"renewed interest\" in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), America scholar Scott Kennedy observed at a seminar in the U.S. on Monday.\nAsked about Kennedy's comment, Lien Yu-ping (連玉蘋), head of MOFA's Department of International Cooperation and Economic Affairs, said at a weekly briefing that the trade war highlighted the importance of regional trade blocs like the CPTPP.\nLien said one of the reasons Beijing wants to join the CPTPP was simply \"to block Taiwan's accession,\" and she pledged that Taiwan would use every available channel to try to mitigate Chinese threats and influence over Taiwan's potential accession to the trade bloc.\nSuch moves include rallying support from Taiwan-friendly CPTPP members as Taiwan tries to persuade the group to focus on whether or not an aspirant meets the \"the Auckland principles.\"\nShe was referring to the requirements set by the CPTPP for new members, which include meeting the trade pact's high standards, demonstrating a strong track record of meeting trade obligations, and garnering a consensus among all members.\nLien said that based on these standards, China is clearly not qualified to join the CPTPP \"given Beijing's extensive use of subsidies and the lack of transparency of state-owned companies.\"\nIn 2025, Australia is the chair of the CPTPP Commission, giving Taiwan a window of opportunity because Australia has always been open to accession requests by economies that are ready to meet the high standards of the agreement, she said.\nChina applied to join the CPTPP in Sept. 16, 2021, roughly a week before Taiwan applied to join on Sept. 22 that same year.\nBeijing, which regards Taiwan as part of its territory, has opposed Taiwan's accession to the CPTPP. This has led Taiwanese officials to worry that a successful bid by China could sink Taiwan's hopes of joining the bloc.\nDuring the Vancouver summit held in November 2024, CPTPP members did not reach an agreement on either Taiwan or China's application to join the trade bloc.\nInstead the CPTPP greenlighted the launching of an accession process for Costa Rica, which applied to join the bloc in August 2022, a year later than China and Taiwan.\nThe CPTPP is one of the biggest trade blocs in the world, representing around 15 percent of the global economy.\nIt currently has 12 members -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the United Kingdom."

One involves borrowing from financial institutions, collateralized by stock held by the National Treasury in public and private enterprises, with a ceiling of NT$200 billion.\nThe second involves borrowing from the postal deposit system, Postal Life Insurance Fund, Labor Insurance Fund, Labor Pension Fund, and Civil Servant Pension Fund, with a ceiling at NT$300 billion.\nKuo said he has proposed to remove the ceilings of the two borrowing sources to allow the fund to have flexibility in raising funds to counter turbulence in the market.\nThe stabilization fund was set up in 2000 by the government to serve as a buffer against unexpected external factors that might disrupt the local bourse.\nAccording to Kuo, since the stabilization fund was established, the market's value has jumped to more than NT$70 trillion today from NT$8 trillion in 2000.\nWhen the local stock market encountered headwinds from the Trump administration's tariff threats, the stabilization fund committee decided to intervene starting from April 8, marking the ninth intervention since its establishment.\nSince the United States imposed a 32 percent tariff on goods from Taiwan on April 2, the Taiex had fallen 1,440.55 points, or 6.76 percent, to 19,857.67 as of Tuesday.\nThe index has recovered part of its steep losses from April 9, when the Taiex closed at 17,391.76, after Trump announced a 90-day pause on the new measures, with reduced 10 percent duties to be applied instead to all countries but China.\nOn Wednesday, Chuang said the stabilization fund has never used the second borrowing source and she believed the fund's executive secretary is very careful when managing the fund to support the market and shore up investor confidence.\nCurrently, the fund's executive secretary is Vice Finance Minister Juan Ching-hua (阮清華).\nChuang said she has also watched closely the decline in turnover in the local stock market as many investors preferred to stay on the sidelines amid tariff concerns, which have affected global economic conditions.\nAccording to the MOF, the average combined turnover of the main board and the over-the-counter market shrank to NT$400.4 billion in March, down 27.4 percent from a year earlier.\nTherefore, revenue from stock transaction taxes also fell to NT$21.9 billion in March, down 24.6 percent from a year earlier, marking the steepest decline in 26 months."

Violators could be fined up to NT$3 million, Kuo said.\nThe promotion of the measures has been targeted at fastener and machine tool industries because some of their materials are imported from China for processing in Taiwan.\nAccording to the Foreign Trade Act, should an exporter/importer falsely label their products' country of origin, they could be issued a warning, given an administrative fine from NT$60,000 to NT$3 million or ordered to suspend business.\nIn the most serious cases, they could have their export/import registration revoked.\nTo keep companies from committing violations due to unfamiliarity with country of origin rules, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said it held a meeting on the topic Tuesday attended by more than 600 people representing the machinery, electronics, metals, and other sectors.\nThe Ministry of Finance said in a report presented at a hearing of the Legislature's Finance Committee, meanwhile, that it has set up a task force to strengthen inspections of illegal transshipments at customs to prevent the use of Taiwan as a base for re-exports to the U.S. to avoid higher duties.\nThe ministry will also actively collect domestic and foreign intelligence to identify suspicious manufacturers and products and analyze violation patterns through big data, according to the report.\nIt will also study the feasibility of rewarding informants who report violations, according to Customs Administration Director General Peng Ying-wei (彭英偉), who attended the legislative session Wednesday."

    "content": "Taipei, April 16 (CNA) A team at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) has performed the world's first heart transplant with zero ischemic time, using a new system that ensures the donor heart never skips a beat and thus reduces damage.\nIn traditional heart transplant surgeries, the heart stops beating after it is procured from the donor, and the period from procurement to implantation is referred to as the ischemic time, said Chi Nai-hsin (紀乃新), an attending physician at NTUH's Cardiovascular Center.\n\"We wanted to perform a heart transplant without any ischemic time so that the heart wouldn't have to stop, and we could also avoid injury [to heart tissue] that typically occurs after reperfusion,\" Chi said at a news conference at the hospital in Taipei on Wednesday.\nWhile the ischemic time for most heart transplants is typically kept under four hours, Chi said shorter durations mean less myocardial damage, higher transplant success rates, and better function, as ischemia leads to oxygen deprivation in cardiac muscle cells.\nTo keep the heart beating and avoid ischemia during the transplant procedure, the NTUH team drew inspiration from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and designed a mobile organ care system (OCS) that can continuously perfuse the heart with oxygenated blood, Chi said.\nAfter receiving approval from NTUH's Research Ethics Committee in April last year, a transplant surgery using the new OCS was performed on a 49-year-old female patient with dilated cardiomyopathy -- a heart muscle disease that makes it harder to pump blood -- in August, Chi said.\nIn a video shown at the news conference, the donor heart was connected to the OCS and continued beating as it was transported to another operating room, where the female patient awaited the transplant.\nAfter the successful transplant, the patient, surnamed Su (蘇), resumed normal daily life with a heart that never skipped a beat, and follow-up assessments showed excellent heart function, Chi said.\nHe cited her low level of cardiac enzyme -- an indicator of heart muscle injury that is typically elevated after transplantation -- as an example of the heart's well-preserved condition following the surgery.\n\"We have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the surgery,\" Chi said, noting that another heart transplant using the same OCS was successfully performed earlier this year, with hopes that the technique can be applied to more cases in the future.\nSu's case and the use of the OCS were featured in an article titled \"First-in-human Zero-Ischemia-Time Beating-Heart Transplant,\" which was accepted for publication by the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Techniques, an international peer-reviewed journal, in late March.\nIn the same journal, a team of researchers from Stanford University in the United States published an article in March 2023 titled \"First Beating-Heart Transplant From a Donation after Cardiac Death Donor.\"\nAccording to article's \"central message,\" those Stanford researchers reported \"the ﬁrst case of a beating heart transplant with uninterrupted coronary perfusion in a heart procured from a deceased after circulatory death.\"\nAsked about the difference between NTUH's procedure and Stanford's, Chen Yih-shurng (陳益祥), head of NTUH's Organ Transplant Team, said that the Stanford team briefly stopped the donor heart after procurement before connecting it to the OCS, resulting in a short ischemic period of about 10 to 30 minutes.\nFor the two cases performed by NTUH's team, \"the hearts were still beating before procurement, continued beating after procurement, and never stopped -- achieving zero ischemic time,\" Chen said."

(AMD) will further hamper the two AI design heavyweights.\nIn turn, Taiwanese suppliers to these two American companies will also be impacted, Liu told CNA on Wednesday.\nShe was commenting on the U.S. Department of Commerce's (DOC) new export licensing requirements, announced hours earlier, for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which are critical to AI development.\nIn a statement, a DOC spokesperson said the department is committed to implementing U.S. President Donald Trump's policies to safeguard national and economic security.\nAn industrial expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CNA later that day that the latest sanctions were \"ridiculous,\" as the H20 and MI308 chips were designed to comply with U.S. restrictions on exports to China.\nThe expert expressed the view that China is unlikely to be heavily affected by the new sanctions in the short term, as many Chinese buyers have reportedly built up large inventories of H20 and MI308 chips.\nThe bulk of the financial burden will be borne by Nvidia and AMD, the expert said.\nThe U.S.' move to further restrict chip exports to China will prompt Chinese chipmakers to speed up production of chips similar to those made in the U.S., the expert added.\nCiting the example of the Ascend 910B processor, which is close to Nvidia's H20 in terms of efficiency and manufactured by the Chinese company Huawei, the expert said that such efforts could accelerate China's progress toward self-sufficiency.\nIn short, the expert said, the new sanctions are likely to bolster China's semiconductor industry, which would harm not only Nvidia and AMD but also their Taiwanese suppliers.\nAccording to local news analyses on Thursday, the Taiwanese companies most likely to be affected include AI server makers such as Inventec Corp. and Mitac Holdings Corp., which supply Chinese cloud service providers like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia said it will book a quarterly charge of about US$5.5 billion tied to restrictions on exports of its H20 GPUs to China and other destinations.\nIn 2024, the company generated an estimated US$12 billion to US$15 billion in revenue from its H20 GPUs, according to international business news reports.\nMeanwhile, AMD announced Wednesday that it would book charges of about US$800 million related to the sales restrictions imposed on its MI308 GPUs.\nIn the wake of the new sanctions amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the Taiex -- the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange -- fell 1.96 percent to 19,468.00 on Wednesday, as the bellwether electronics sector tumbled 2.27 percent."

The chipmaker will deliver its guidance at the investor conference.\nTSMC, the most heavily weighted local stock, lost 0.94 percent to close at NT$847.00, off a high of NT$856.00. The stock's losses contributed about 65 points to the Taiex's fall and sent the electronics index down 0.64 percent.\n\"Many investors also appeared cautious about TSMC before the Trump administration announces tariffs on semiconductors,\" Hsu said.\nAmong other semiconductor stocks, smartphone IC designer MediaTek Inc. lost 1.87 percent to end at NT$1,340.00, and IC packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. dropped 3.00 percent to close at NT$129.50, while application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designer Alchip Technologies Inc. rose 2.07 percent to end at NT$2,215.00.\nAlso in the tech sector, iPhone assembler and AI server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. shed 1.10 percent to close at NT$134.50, but Quanta Computer Inc., another AI server supplier, gained 1.32 percent to end at NT$230.00.\nStocks outside the tech sector also largely moved in the doldrums amid uncertainties caused by tariff threats by Washington, Hsu said.\nIn the old economy sector, textile supplier Far Eastern New Century Corp. fell 1.38 percent to close at NT$32.15, and Eclat Textile Co. shed 3.15 percent to end at NT$384.00. In addition, food brand Uni-President Enterprises Corp. dropped 1.56 percent to close at NT$75.60 and Wei Chuan Foods Corp. ended down 0.31 percent at NT$16.25.\nWith the financial sector down 0.83 percent, Cathay Financial Holding Co. lost 1.64 percent to close at NT$53.90, and Fubon Financial Holding Co. fell 0.62 percent to end at NT$79.60.\n\"As long as turnover stays low, it will be hard for the Taiex to make a meaningful rebound,\" Hsu said. \"The index could see strong technical resistance ahead of 20,000 points.\"\nAccording to the TWSE, foreign institutional investors sold a net NT$13.62 billion worth of shares on the main board Thursday."

    "content": "Taipei, April 17 (CNA) The Bank of Taiwan said Thursday that its gold price reached NT$3,518 (US$108.20) per gram at noon -- a record high reflecting risk aversion in global markets due to the trade war between the United States and China.\nThe bank said its intraday gold passbook price increase represents a 25.6 percent gain since the start of the year, when the price stood at NT$2,801 per gram.\nThe sharp rise in the price was driven by an influx of capital into gold markets amid escalating tariffs between the United States and China, according to the Bank of Taiwan's international gold market report published Thursday.\nIt added that a sharp decline in the U.S. Dollar Index had also triggered capital flows into gold markets, pushing gold prices higher.\nCiting analysis from asset management firms, the bank noted that gold's appeal has further increased due to the precious metal being less affected by tariffs.\nIn a report issued this week, the UBS Wealth Management Chief Investment Office said it raised its 12-month price target for gold to US$3,500 per ounce, citing concerns over tariffs, inflation, geopolitical risks, and shifting interest rate expectations.\nUBS said demand for gold was also being driven by structural changes in allocation, including a February decision by Chinese regulators allowing insurance funds to invest in gold, and systematic reserve increases by central banks in various countries."

His last came in November 2021, when he bested Hsu Hao-hung (許皓鋐) 4-3 in the Go Grandmaster Tournament final series.\nDespite breaking his title drought, Lin said the win felt \"a little imperfect\" since Hsu Hao-hung -- the 2023 Hangzhou Asian Games gold medalist -- did not participate in this year's tournament.\nHsu, also a 9-dan player, claimed all eight major domestic titles in Taiwan in 2024. He has said he plans to focus more on international tournaments in 2025 and will not compete in every local event this year.\nReflecting on his struggles over the past two years, Lin described himself as \"someone who deals with frustration effectively,\" crediting his love for the game with helping him navigate through difficult times.\nGo, he said, \"allows us players to express our personalities through the stones.\"\nLin said finding opportunities to beat top opponents gave him confidence. \"I enjoy seeing how far Go can take me.\"\nLin's next target is the Taiwan Meijin title, where he is set to face 8-dan pro Chen Chi-jui (陳祈睿) in a best-of-three semifinal series.\nThe champion of the Taiwan Meijin will receive NT$1.8 million in prize money, the highest of all domestic tournaments.\n\"I'm still glad that my form this year is much better than in the past two years, and that I've regained some confidence with this title,\" he said."

    "date": "2025-04-17",
    "content": "Taipei, April 17 (CNA) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) said on Thursday the company has left its guidance for 2025 unchanged despite uncertainties posted by the Trump administration's tariff policies.\nAt an investor conference, TSMC Chairman C.C. Wei (魏哲家) said while the U.S. tariff actions have created risks to the market, the chipmaker's clients have not made any changes to their business ties with the company so it is still forecasting sales will grow 24-26 percent from a year earlier in 2025 in U.S. dollar terms.\nOn the back of growing popularity for emerging technologies including artificial intelligence applications, Wei said TSMC's sales are expected to continue to beat the entire global pure wafer foundry business.\nAccording to Wei, sales in the global pure wafer foundry business, including IC assembly and testing and photomasking, are expected to grow 10 percent in 2025.\nHowever, TSMC will keep a close eye on possible changes in end-user demand in the market resulting from U.S. tariff policies, Wei said.\nOn April 2, U.S. President Donald Trump announced \"reciprocal\" tariffs on countries which have trade surpluses with Washington, including Taiwan, which has been slapped with a 32 percent tariff, while the White House announced a 90-day pause on the new measures last week, with a 10 percent duty to be applied instead to all countries except China.\nIn addition, Trump said on April 12 that his administration would be taking a look at semiconductors and the entire electronics supply chain as part of its National Security Tariff Investigations.\nTSMC has benefited from strong global demand for AI devices, and expects sales of graphics processing units (GPUs) used in AI training and reasoning, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), high bandwidth memory (HBM) controllers and AI accelerators to double in 2025, Wei said.\nWith the growing demand for AI applications, TSMC is determined to meet the needs of its clients for 3D Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) IC packaging services, expecting CoWoS production capacity to double this year and be entirely utilized, he added.\nCoWoS demand and supply is excepted to stay healthy in 2026, Wei said.\nBefore the investor conference, TSMC released its first quarter results, posting record January-March net profit of NT$361.56 billion (US$11.11 billion), up 60.4 percent from a year earlier. However, first quarter net profit fell 3.5 percent from a quarter earlier due to traditional slow season effects.\nSpeaking at the investor conference, TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang (黃仁昭) said the chipmaker expects to generate US$28.4 billion to US$29.2 billion in consolidated sales in the second quarter with the median figure likely to grow 13 percent from the first quarter.\nThe expected growth largely reflects strong demand for TSMC's high end processes -- 3 nanometer and 5nm processes -- in the current AI boom, Wei said. The 3nm process is the latest technology TSMC has started commercial production.\nHowever, due to higher production costs in the chipmaker's overseas facilities, TSMC's gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- will range from 57 percent to 59 percent, with the median figure likely to fall 0.8 percentage points from the first quarter, according to Huang.\nThe chipmaker's first wafer fabs in the U.S. state of Arizona and Kumamoto, Japan started commercial production in 2024."

    "content": "Taipei, April 17 (CNA) Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) on Wednesday announced a research breakthrough that enables a simple blood test to detect individuals at high risk of Alzheimer's disease with around 90 percent accuracy by analyzing specific proteins in blood plasma.\nOne in every 12 people in Taiwan aged 65 and above is at risk of dementia, Fuh Jong-ling (傅中玲), deputy head of TVGH's Department of Neurology, Neurological Institute, said at a news conference held at the hospital in Taipei.\nAlzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia, accounting for 56.88 percent of cases, according to a report published by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in 2024 and cited by Fuh.\nAlzheimer's is caused by the accumulation of proteins in the brain that leads to the death of neurons and has two key pathological features in the brain, Fuh said.\nThe first and most prominent feature is amyloid plaques -- unusual clumps of a protein called beta amyloid found between nerve cells -- the second, though also significant, is neurofibrillary tangles -- bundles of twisted filaments found within neurons, largely made up of a protein called tau, according to Fuh.\nShe said that in the past, diagnosing Alzheimer's disease relied heavily on cerebrospinal fluid analysis or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\nBoth are invasive and expensive -- NT$70,000 (US$2,152) for a PET scan -- limiting public access to the two diagnostic tools, Fuh added.\nHowever, a team formed by researchers from Taiwan and South Korea -- including Fuh and Lin Yung-shuan (林詠萱) of TVGH -- found a strong correlation between phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau) in blood plasma and the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain, paving the way for a more cost-effective and less invasive method of early detection.\nThey discovered that p-tau217 -- a variant of p-tau that differs from others in its phosphorylation sites -- demonstrated greater accuracy in predicting early-stage Alzheimer's disease than the previously used p-tau181, Fuh said.\nIn January, the team tested a total of 270 participants from Taiwan and South Korea, including healthy individuals, people with mild cognitive impairment, and dementia patients, she said.\nBy comparing blood test results with PET scans, the researchers found that the higher the concentration of p-tau217 in blood plasma, the more likely the individual was to be associated with Alzheimer's disease, Fuh added.\nAmong those deemed high-risk by the blood test, 86 percent were confirmed to have Alzheimer's disease through PET scans, while among those classified as low-risk, 97 percent were found to be free of it, Fuh said.\n\"This can really help the public in several ways,\" Fuh said, noting that those identified by the blood test as low-risk individuals do not need to undergo further testing, while those classified as high-risk individuals are likely to have Alzheimer's disease and should receive treatment.\nShe added that the findings also suggest that in the future, only individuals classified as medium-risk may need further PET scans, which could reduce unnecessary and costly testing while enabling earlier detection.\nFuh said she hopes blood tests will become a first-line screening tool in the future, helping guide elderly individuals to seek medical attention as early as possible after showing symptoms such as memory decline.\nThe research finding by the Taiwan-South Korean team was featured in an article titled \"Cross-cultural validation of plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 as precision biomarkers for amyloid PET positivity: An East Asian study in Taiwan and Korea,\" which was published by Alzheimer's & Dementia, an international medical journal, in late January."

Any one of us could be the next victim if we stand against those in power,\" Chiang said.\nUnder the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China, if a no-confidence vote is passed, the premier may request the president to dissolve the Legislative Yuan.\nAddressing the possibility of Lai dissolving the Legislature, Chiang said he believed the public would express their dissatisfaction with the ruling party by voting for opposition candidates in any subsequent legislative election.\nAccording to the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China, the Legislative Yuan may propose a no-confidence vote against the premier with the signatures of at least one-third of all lawmakers.\nThe motion can then be passed with a majority of the body's 113 seats. If passed, the premier shall tender his resignation within 10 days and may request the president to dissolve the Legislature.\nIf the vote fails, the Legislature cannot launch another vote against the same premier within one year.\nAt present, the KMT controls 54 votes in the 113-seat Legislature and the opposition Taiwan People's Party (TPP) controls eight.\nThe TPP has also accused the DPP of overstepping the boundaries of justice, arguing that indictments on corruption charges against its former Chairman Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) were not backed by evidence and were politically motivated.\nChiang was among the first KMT municipal leaders to announce his participation in the protest after KMT Chair Eric Chu (朱立倫) earlier in the day called on the public to voice their anger and frustration with the Taipei District Prosecutors Office.\nHuang Lu Chin-ju (黃呂錦茹), chairwoman of the KMT's Taipei chapter, was one of four individuals taken in for questioning by Taipei prosecutors on Thursday. Early Friday morning, prosecutors requested court approval to detain them.\nIn a statement late Thursday, the DPP accused the KMT of \"law-breaking behavior,\" saying the protest led by Chu proved that the main opposition party was behind the destabilization of Taiwanese society and undermining of its democracy.DPP spokesperson Justin Wu (吳崢) said it was the KMT that had \"pushed through\" the amended \"Public Officials Election and Recall Act\" in the Legislature on Dec. 20, 2024, making forging petitions a criminal offence, in the statement.Instead of apologizing to the public, the KMT attacked the judicial system after \"being caught for its attempt to cheat by forging petitions to initiate recall votes,\" Wu said.Wu also criticized Chiang for actively encouraging the \"illegal protest,\" saying the Taipei mayor has set a bad example by creating difficulties for local police.The DPP spokesperson urged people across the country to \"deplore the KMT and its disregard for the law.\""

    "content": "By Chao Yen-hsiang, CNA staff writer\nMore than 75 years after the publication of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\" the Orwellian phrase \"Big Brother is watching you\" has become so familiar to most of the Taiwanese public that even those who haven't read the novel recognize it.\nThat phrase has now been given a new look -- \"大兄哥咧共你看\" -- by amateur translator Tsiu Ing-sing (周盈成), who recently completed the first full Taiwanese translation of George Orwell's dystopian classic.\nIn an interview with CNA, Tsiu -- who completed the nearly 160,000-word project in his spare time over four years -- said his goal was to \"prove it possible\" that foreign literature could be rendered in Taiwanese.\nThe translation is part of his decade-long push to \"normalize\" the use of Taiwanese in broader cultural contexts.\n\"With more books like this coming out and becoming part of daily life for the younger generation, people will see this as part of their culture [rather than] just something they hear when talking with their grandparents,\" he said.\n● Re-Joyce in translation: Scholar breathes Sinitic life into 'Finnegans Wake'\nControlling Taiwanese's futureNow 55, Tsiu is a businessman with more than a decade of translation-related experience.He previously worked as an English-language reporter for local media and as editor-in-chief of the National Geographic Chinese edition in Taiwan. He has also translated two English books and one French book into Chinese. His translation of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" marks his first foray into Taiwanese.Tsiu Ing-sing takes an interview with CNA in Taipei on April 3. CNA photo April 18, 2025As one of the few people translating foreign literature into Taiwanese, Tsiu described the process as \"problem-solving.\"\"When I was working on it, I felt like I didn't see anyone ahead of me on this road -- I had to find my own way,\" he said.His solutions involved consulting Taiwanese experts and four major dictionaries, including one compiled by the Ministry of Education in the late 2000s.Still, he sometimes invented expressions even when existing ones were available to \"introduce something new.\"Since some Taiwanese words change meaning depending on pronunciation, he chose Romanized spelling in certain cases to highlight sounds. In others, he used Romanization and Chinese characters interchangeably to show that Romanization is just as valid.Tsiu said his translation allows readers who can read Chinese but not understand spoken Taiwanese to still follow the general plot because of its mixed use of Chinese characters with Romanization -- a mainstream approach in Taiwanese writing circles.Despite these efforts, Tsiu said the translation will likely still be challenging for most readers, as the novel is not an easy read and Taiwanese speakers come from diverse backgrounds.\"I would even encourage people to read the English version first, then come to mine to see how these ideas are expressed in Taiwanese,\" he said.Why Taiwanese?Tsiu, who grew up in Taipei, said he learned little Taiwanese in school and picked up most of what he knew from conversations among relatives and friends.His interest in studying the language seriously began after he returned to Taiwan from Geneva, where he had been a foreign correspondent, in 2010.\"When we spoke Mandarin abroad, we were usually assumed to be Chinese. That made me wonder what my connection to Taiwan was, and the answer was Taiwanese,\" he said.Tsiu Ing-sing. CNA photo April 12, 2025\"There were moments when we wanted to talk privately and would try to use Taiwanese.

His translation somehow serves the same function.\"In many ways, Taiwanese reads more naturally and makes more sense to us Taiwanese people. We are just deprived of the opportunities to recognize that fact.\"Truth and untruthTsiu said his political science and criminal justice education, including postgraduate work at the University of Edinburgh, sparked his interest in themes like surveillance, state power, and totalitarianism that are crucial in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four.\"Still, he said he had no intention of translating the novel until 2017, when it unexpectedly topped the U.S. Amazon bestseller list in the wake of Kellyanne Conway's \"alternative facts\" comment.Conway, an adviser to then-President Donald Trump, used the phrase in reference to then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's inaccurate claim that Trump drew the largest presidential inauguration crowd in history.While Tsiu said that \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" has everlasting political relevance, he disagreed with those who draw a comparison with Trump, noting that the novel specifically depicts life under totalitarian rule.For a democracy like Taiwan, however, he said the novel resonates most due to the threat of China's dictatorship.Given the looming threat of Taiwan being absorbed into a \"Big Brother\" state, as noted in the afterword, Tsiu said the risk of Taiwan facing a \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" scenario would be \"being infiltrated, controlled, and annexed by China.\"Tsiu Ing-sing.

    "content": "Taipei, April 18 (CNA) A presidential re-election would be necessary if President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) were to dissolve the parliament in response to a passed no-confidence motion against the Cabinet, Taiwan People's Party (TPP) Chairman Huang Kuo-chang (黃國昌) said Friday.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Taipei, Huang criticized Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an's (蔣萬安) proposal for a no-confidence vote against Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰), arguing it would play into the hands of Lai's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).\n\"The DPP has been advocating for dissolving the Legislature in recent months,\" Huang said in response to Chiang's proposal announced during a protest Thursday night.\n\"How can it be considered a vote of no-confidence against Lai Ching-te if he remains in office after a legislative re-election? This would only gift the DPP an opportunity to reverse the situation and salvage their debacle,\" Huang said.\nOn Thursday evening, Chiang, a member of Taiwan's major opposition Kuomintang (KMT), urged opposition parties to initiate a no-confidence motion against Premier Cho in protest of what he said was the Lai administration's abuse of judicial powers to target government critics.\nAs of Thursday, four KMT local offices had been raided and more than a dozen people questioned over allegations of fraudulent signatures on petitions to initiative recalls against DPP lawmakers.\nUnder Taiwan's Additional Articles of the Constitution, if a no-confidence vote passes, the premier may request the president to dissolve the Legislative Yuan.\nChiang expressed confidence that the public would express dissatisfaction with the ruling party by voting for opposition candidates in any subsequent legislative election.\nOn Friday, when the Taipei mayor was asked about his call for a vote of no-confidence, he said he was simply advocating an idea as he was not a lawmaker and did not have a position within the KMT, and therefore had no authority in the matter.\nIf Lai were to dissolve the Legislature following a vote of no-confidence, however, people could think about Taiwan's future from a more comprehensive perspective.\nMeanwhile, KMT Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) said his party \"does not rule out any measures that are beneficial to Taiwan's democracy and can make the leader step down.\"\nChu underscored the KMT's commitment to safeguarding Taiwan's democracy and holding the government accountable, and he invited other opposition parties to join discussions on the matter.\nChu, who mobilized supporters to protest outside the Taipei District Prosecutors Office on Thursday evening, called on the public to voice their discontent with the DPP during a rally in front of the Presidential Office scheduled for April 26 at 3 p.m.\nThe TPP has not decided whether its members will attend the assembly and will announce its conclusion later, according to Huang.\nIn response to Chiang's proposal, Premier Cho and DPP legislative caucus secretary-general Wu Szu-yao (吳思瑤) questioned the KMT's public support and the propriety of Chiang raising the issue given his mayoral status.\nPointing out that recall motions against KMT local lawmakers have passed initial thresholds, Wu suggested that the KMT missed the optimal timing to push for a Cabinet dismissal.\nLikewise, Ker Chien-ming (柯建銘), the DPP's legislative caucus whip, said that Chiang made the proposal in Chu's stead showed that \"the KMT is done already.\"\n\"I will absolutely support it if the KMT dares launch the Cabinet dismissal,\" he said."

    "content": "Taipei, April 18 (CNA) Taiwan's school textbook regulator has called on publishers to specify that a United Nations resolution, which led to the Republic of China (Taiwan's official name) leaving the multilateral body, does not mention Taiwan.\nTextbooks should present the texts of U.N. Resolution 2758 in both Chinese and English and specify there is no mention of the Republic of China or Taiwan in the document, according to the National Academy for Educational Research.\nSpeaking with CNA, the academy's Vice President Yen Chin-hsiang (顏慶祥) said the academy, curriculum developers and textbook publishers agreed in a meeting on Wednesday that presenting the U.N. resolution in this way would benefit students' understanding of the historical facts.\nSuch calls were advice, Yen said, adding that the academy was not requiring publishers to make changes accordingly.\nNevertheless, the academy's President Lin Chung-i (林從一) has said textbooks must not remain unchanged and oftentimes, their content should \"respond to academic developments, students' learning needs, and the concerns of different sectors across society.\"\nLin added that it was the National Academy for Educational Research's responsibility to ensure the quality of textbook content, referring to the academy's role of reviewing school textbooks.\nThe U.N. resolution, passed by the 1971 General Assembly, recognized the People's Republic of China (PRC) as \"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations\" and confirmed the expulsion of \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" from the U.N.\nThe resolution addressed the issue of China's representation at the U.N., resulting in representatives from the PRC replacing those from the ROC.\nBeijing claims that the U.N. resolution \"confirmed\" its \"one China principle,\" which asserts there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is \"an inalienable part of China.\"\nTaipei rejects such claims, saying the U.N. resolution does not mention Taiwan or address Taiwan's political status.\nIn addition to the Cairo Declaration, junior high school textbooks should also include the Treaty of San Francisco and the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty, according to the academy.\nYen said it was \"simplified\" for current textbooks to say that under the Cairo Declaration, Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu were returned to the ROC and that this characterization might \"mislead\" students into thinking that \"the future of Taiwan\" was determined by \"a few political figures.\"\nThe declaration followed the 1943 meeting in Cairo, Egypt, between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and ROC leader Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石).\nYen said that by the time the declaration was signed, World War II was not over yet, and there remained debates in academia over whether the document carries binding force.\nAccording to Yen, the academy considers it appropriate to include the other two treaties signed after the war to illustrate how Japan, which colonized Taiwan from 1895 to 1945, \"relinquished all rights to Taiwan, Penghu, Spratly Islands and Paracel Islands.\"\nProviding students with a comprehensive timeline helps them better understand Taiwan's post-war status, he said, adding that the discussions to change the textbook content had been suggested by scholars since last year."

    "content": "Taipei, April 18 (CNA) Taiwan's Supreme Court on Friday revoked the death sentence of Liang Yu-chih (梁育誌), who was convicted of murdering a Malaysian university student in 2020, and ordered a new trial.\nThe court said the most recent ruling by the Taiwan High Court Kaohsiung Branch, issued in January, failed to thoroughly examine the evidence and did not provide sufficient reasoning. The case can still be appealed.\nThis is the first case to reaffirm a death sentence after Taiwan's Constitutional Court ruled in September 2024 that capital punishment is conditionally constitutional.\nThe crime occurred on Oct. 28, 2020, when Liang abducted the victim -- a Malaysian student studying in Tainan -- while she was walking alone near her university.\nHe raped, beat, and then strangled her to death, took her belongings, and dumped her body in a mountainous area of Kaohsiung's Alian District, according to the high court.\nThe court said Liang had acted with premeditation, lying in wait with a rope that he used to kill the 24-year-old victim with brutal force.\nShe suffered multiple internal injuries, and the court upheld the death sentence based on the cruelty of the crime and the high risk of reoffending.\nHowever, the Supreme Court said the retrial misapplied the law by treating the incident as a single offense of rape and murder. It should have been prosecuted as multiple crimes -- robbery, sexual assault and murder -- with separate penalties.\nThe court also questioned Liang's intent, noting records suggest he may have initially planned only sexual assault before deciding to commit murder.\nAdditionally, the trial court failed to consider a prison counselor's assessment that Liang had potential for rehabilitation, which may have impacted sentencing, it said.\nLiang was first sentenced to death by the Ciaotou District Court in March 2022 for rape, intentional killing, and robbery.\nThe high court upheld the verdict in March 2023.\nIn June 2023, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial of the rape and homicide charges, citing flaws in the original ruling."

    "date": "2025-04-18",
    "content": "Taipei, April 18 (CNA) A student advocacy group on Friday released the results of a gender equity survey conducted at 17 universities across Taiwan, revealing that all institutions fell short in areas such as support for LGBTQ students and the functioning of legally required gender equity committees.\nTwo days ahead of Taiwan's Gender Equity Education Day on Sunday, the Student Alliance for Gender Equality held a news conference in Taipei, where the group's representatives highlighted areas needing improvement in the implementation of gender equity across the country's public and private universities.\nUnder the Gender Equality Education Act, every school in Taiwan must have a gender equality committee to \"investigate and handle cases\" related to gender equity at schools and \"plan and establish a safe and gender-fair campus,\" among other responsibilities.\nAmong those 17 universities, \"two did not make their gender equity committee member lists available, and only two disclosed members' stances on gender equity or relevant professional experience,\" said Sydney Shao (邵思宇), a student at National Taiwan University (NTU).\nShao, who also serves as a student member of NTU's gender equity committee, said that none of the 17 universities allow students to participate in the committee's selection process, and 10 of them do not even disclose the criteria used to select committee members.\n\"How can students who have been hurt feel reassured under such an opaque system?\" Shao questioned.\nShao added that even if a student decides to file a complaint, they are faced with a \"harsh reality\" of severely understaffed gender equity committees.\nSix of the surveyed schools have no full-time personnel handling gender equity affairs, with responsibilities managed part-time by other staff, Shao said, noting that at universities with dedicated staff -- such as NTU -- one full-time officer is responsible for the needs of nearly 8,000 students.\nFor individuals with diverse gender identities, Lillian Hsiao (蕭錦蓮), a student at Kaohsiung Medical University's Graduate Institute of Gender Studies, said that Article 20 of the Gender Equity Education Act stipulates that \"teachers shall maintain an awareness of gender equity, eliminate gender stereotypes, and avoid gender prejudice and discrimination.\"\nHowever, many institutions have yet to fully implement such support, Hsiao said, citing data showing that only four of the 17 universities established anonymous reporting mechanisms that are consistently available to address discrimination.\nHsiao said that a nonbinary student once shared with the group that a teacher had publicly questioned them in class, asking, \"Are you a boy or a girl?\"\n\"Most of the classmates laughed after hearing the question, while the student remained silent as they did not know who they could report it to, and were afraid that speaking up might affect their grades,\" Hsiao said.\n\"This kind of discrimination based on gender identity makes it impossible for students to feel reassured while learning in class,\" Hsiao added.\nOutside the classroom, dormitory arrangements in most schools are also far from inclusive, especially for transgender students, according to Josephine Tai (戴靜茹), a student at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.\nOnly six universities provide gender-friendly dormitories, and 14 have not made their transfer mechanisms for gender-diverse students publicly available, Tai said.\nWhen seeking to change dormitories, transgender students often cannot find a designated contact point or clear procedures to follow, leaving them in a state of uncertainty and anxiety throughout the process, Tai noted.\nIn response to the group's concerns, Wu Lin-hui (吳林輝), head of the Ministry of Education's (MOE) Department of Student Affairs and Special Education, told reporters later on Friday that the ministry had previously conducted a survey and also found that some schools lacked stable staffing to handling gender equity affairs.\nWhile such a type of staffing falls under university autonomy, Wu said the MOE had sent notices to universities as a follow-up to its own survey, urging them to prioritize the allocation of full-time personnel.\nRegarding the lack of gender-friendly dormitories, Wu said that, unlike barrier-free facilities, such dormitories are not explicitly mandated under current building regulations.\nThe MOE is currently promoting gender-friendly dormitories through policy guidance and resource support to help universities \"move forward at a quicker pace\" toward achieving gender equity, he added."

Now, they are coming after the KMT. First, the youth, now ordinary citizens. We will not allow the DPP to turn the judiciary into a weapon, dragging the entire society into fear and silence.\"\nSpeaking on the second night of the protest outside the prosecutors' office, Chu said it was everyone's responsibility to gather on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Building on April 26 and let Lai hear the public's fury and disappointment over his alleged abuse of judicial power.\n\"All of us standing here and now share the same crime - opposing President Lai Ching‑te. Taiwan faces a crossroads for its democracy, and we must step up and combat dictatorship. Otherwise, Taiwan has no future,\" he said.\nChu's remarks came after prosecutors raided the party's Taipei office on Thursday, detaining four staffers -- including Taipei chapter chair Huang Lu Chin‑ju (黃呂錦茹) -- for questioning over allegations that petitions to initiate an election to recall DPP lawmakers contained fake signatures.\nProsecutors later sought court approval to detain the KMT staffers on suspicion of forgery.\nAt around 5 a.m. Saturday, the court ordered that the 75‑year‑old Huang Lu and Tseng Fan‑chuan (曾繁川) be released without bail. However, the other two staffers, Chu Wen‑ching (初文卿) and Yao Fu‑wen (姚富文), were detained and held incommunicado.\nThe DPP has not responded to KMT's planned assembly on April 26, but in a Thursday statement, it said local election commissions have found nearly 20,000 problematic petitions for recalls of its lawmakers, including 1,923 with signatures of dead people, accusing the KMT of being the biggest threat to democracy in Taiwan.\nIt also condemned the KMT's protest outside the prosecutors' office as \"illegal.\"\n\"It proves that the Kuomintang is the biggest culprit who undermines Taiwan's social stability and hurts the democratic constitutional system,\" DPP spokesperson Justin Wu (吳崢) said in the statement.\nChu, who embraced Huang Lu after the court hearing early Saturday, said the raids by prosecutors and the Investigation Bureau signaled the DPP's attempt to eliminate the one force blocking the Lai administration's realization of a party‑state.\nHe alleged a double standard, citing that there were nearly 100 allegedly fake signatures collected by a DPP-backed campaign to initiate a recall vote against then‑Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo‑yu (韓國瑜) from the KMT in 2020, noting that prosecutors at the time did not even attempt to question those involved, claiming that they could not proceed with the case.\n\"[The judicial system] obviously targets the KMT,\" he argued, saying the Lai administration is \"only one step away from declaring martial law.\""

    "date": "2025-04-19",
    "content": "Taipei, April 19 (CNA) Taiwan could continue to be placed on the currency monitoring list of the United States Treasury Department, which is likely to release its twice-a-year foreign exchange policy report later in April, according to the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan).\nSpeaking with reporters, Tsai Chiung-min (蔡炯民), head of the central bank's Foreign Exchange Department, said on Friday that Taiwan could meet two of the three criteria set by the U.S. Treasury Department and see a continued inclusion into the currency watch list.\nIn November 2024, Taiwan was included in the watch list, marking its sixth straight appearance, based on the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 applied by the report, which analyzed the practices of Washington's major trading partners.\nThe U.S. Treasury report uses three criteria to determine which trading partners will be named as currency manipulators.\nThe three criteria include a bilateral trade surplus with the U.S. hitting at least US$15 billion and a material current account surplus accounting for at least 3 percent of an economy's gross domestic product (GDP).\nThe third criterion is designed to assess whether an economy gets involved in persistent one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange market when net purchases of foreign currency are conducted repeatedly, in at least eight out of 12 months, with these net purchases making up at least 2 percent of its GDP over 12 months.\nWhen an economy meets two of the three criteria, it will be automatically put on the watch list. When an economy meets just one of the three criteria for two currency reports in a row, it will be removed from the monitoring list.\nTsai said that due to Taiwan's economic structure, it is expected to meet the first two criteria. In 2024, Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. hit US$73.9 billion. Its material current account surplus accounts for at least 3 percent of its GDP.\nBut Tsai said Taiwan was not expected to meet the third criterion because it is unlikely to be perceived as an economy involved in one-sided intervention in the forex market.\nWhile there are rumors that the Taiwan dollar has been undervalued against the U.S. dollar to allow Taipei to enjoy a high trade surplus with the Washington, Tsai said the central bank's recent market intervention either prevented the local currency from falling too much or rising too rapidly.\nTsai said the central bank's intervention efforts were aimed at easing volatility in the market and maintaining order, adding the bank has never only sent the currency lower, but instead adopted a two-way approach.\nTsai reiterated that the central bank always respected a market mechanism when it came to the value of the Taiwan dollar.\nTsai said that although the Trump administration is highly unpredictable, Taiwan's central bank has built an effective communications channel with the U.S. Treasury Department, and both sides will continue to exchange views on issues such as the microeconomy and their forex policies.\nMeanwhile, the central bank issued a report on Friday, saying it was inappropriate for the U.S. to use forex manipulation as a factor as it enters trade negotiations with other countries at a time when Washington wants to use tariff hikes against its trading partners, which have high trade surpluses with the U.S.\nCiting Martin Feldstein, the former head of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers, Taiwan's central bank said the U.S. has recorded a long-term current account deficit, which largely reflects its low domestic savings, instead of its trading partners' forex policies. The current account primarily measures a country's exports and imports of goods and services.\nIn the report, the central bank also agreed with Feldstein, saying that with the U.S. Federal Reserve using quantitative easing to adjust its monetary policy, which has sent the U.S. dollar lower, Washington cannot blame other countries for currency manipulation.\nTsai said a country with an imbalance in the current account needs to address an imbalance in domestic savings and investments, adding that a country with a large current account deficit should boost savings, while a country sitting on a large current account surplus should cut its excess savings.\n(By Pan Tzu-yu and Frances Huang)\nEnditem/cs"

    "date": "2025-04-19",
    "content": "Taipei, April 19 (CNA) The torpedo bat is likely to make its debut in Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) sooner than expected after the league announced a way for certified bat providers to quickly get new types of bats into the hands of CPBL players.\nUnder a new league rule announced Friday, once a bat brand gets certified by the league, it can add new types of bats to its product list for the CPBL simply by submitting two samples for each type to the CPBL, the league said in a Friday announcement.\nThe new bats do not have to be individually tested, and the list can be updated once a year, according to the league.\nThat means that if any of the 23 certified bat producers present a torpedo bat sample to the league, it could enter service rather quickly.\nThe CPBL said Friday that it has had extensive discussions on the use of the torpedo bat and had received samples from one manufacturer, but it did not reveal when those samples were received or if it had received any following the latest change in its regulations.\nStill, the league said torpedo bats could make their CPBL debut as soon as Monday.\nThe move comes amid heightened interest among CPBL players in experimenting with the so-called torpedo bat, a design that has sparked considerable debate in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States.\nThe New York Yankees put the torpedo bats in the spotlight when most of the team's players used them to hit 15 home runs and score 36 runs in their season-opening three-game series against the Milwaukee Brewers.\nBut the jury is still out on how much the bats really help. Yankees shortshop Anthony Volpe, who hit four home runs in the first five games of 2025 using the new equipment, still has four home runs 20 games into the season and is hitting .197.\nUnlike standard bats, which distribute mass evenly throughout the barrel, torpedo bats concentrate their mass closer to the batter's arms, specifically targeting the sweet spot, while fully complying with MLB regulations governing bat specifications.\nCommenting on the bats' potential advantages, retired CPBL player turned bat manufacturer Liu Fu-hao (劉芙豪) noted on April 3 that torpedo bats may better suit MLB batters.\n\"Torpedo bats shorten the swing trajectory and enhance ball contact,\" he explained, suggesting they cater to hitters whose sweet spots are nearer to their bodies.\nSeveral CPBL players, including 2024 CPBL Taiwan Series MVP Tseng Song-en (曾頌恩) of the CTBC Brothers and 2024 WBSC Premier12 MVP Chen Chieh-hsien (陳傑憲) of the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions, have provided positive feedback after testing the unconventional bats.\nUni-Lions veteran Hu Chin-lung (胡金龍) expressed a preference for standard bats, however, due to their superior balance.\nThe impact of torpedo bats on game dynamics and player health remains uncertain.\nFor instance, New York Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton continues to be sidelined this season due to persistent elbow pain after using torpedo bats in 2024, though no direct link to the bats has been established or ruled out."

The court cited concerns that he could tamper with evidence or collude with other individuals involved in the case.\nAccording to court documents released on Sunday, Hsu admitted that many of the signatures on his organization's recall petition documents were not provided by actual supporters, but were written by himself or campaign volunteers.\nAlthough Hsu denied illegally collecting personal data or forging documents, the court said digital evidence on two confiscated phones and witness testimony pointed to \"suspected serious illegality.\"\nThe Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office alleged that Hsu deleted files and chat records related to the recall vote campaign and advised others, including a man named Chu Lei (朱磊) and a woman identified by her surname Huang (黃), on how to respond to judicial inquiries.\nHuang was released without bail after being questioned on Friday and Chu was released on bail of NT$150,000 early Saturday, prosecutors said.\nThe court said the facts of the case remain unclear and that the risk of collusion with others who have not yet been questioned justified Hsu's pre-trial detention.\nHsu ran the campaign organization \"Double Strike Petition Headquarters\" (雙罷劫連署總站) that coordinated signature collections for campaigns against DPP lawmakers Hsu Chih-chieh (許智傑) and Huang Jie (黃捷), both of whom represent electoral districts in Kaohsiung in Taiwan's national legislature.\nThe case is one of several ongoing investigations into alleged illegality in recall vote campaigns targeting DPP lawmakers that have led opposition politicians to accuse the ruling party of using the judiciary to \"persecute\" its political opponents.\nThe main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) protested outside the Taipei prosecutors' office this week and is urging Taiwanese people to assemble in front of the Presidential Office on Saturday.\nThe DPP has rejected the allegation and accused the KMT of threatening Taiwan's social stability and democracy.\nLast week, separate investigations by prosecutors in Taipei and New Taipei resulted in raids and multiple arrests of activists associated with alleged signature forgeries and violations of data protection laws in recall campaigns against DPP lawmakers.\nAccording to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, a public vote is triggered if campaigners collect signatures from 1 percent of district voters in the first round and 10 percent in the second."

    "date": "2025-04-20",
    "content": "By Wu Kuan-hsien, CNA staff reporter\nMost of the time, Vivi successfully juggles life as a student, counselor intern, dance instructor, public speaker, friend and daughter. Yet, one part of her identity remains officially denied to her -- being a woman.\nThe Taipei High Administrative Court denied a request from Vivi, a transgender woman, to change the gender on her ID card in August 2024 because she had not provided the two required official gender diagnoses and had not undergone gender reassignment surgery -- the two general requirements.\nHowever, a month earlier, Nemo became Taiwan's first transgender man to change his legal gender without surgery. The same court ordered authorities to update his ID based on how he self-identified.\nTheir different experiences came down to one key factor: Medical diagnoses.\nLegal ambiguityNemo's victory followed a landmark court ruling in 2021, which stipulated that a transgender woman, Xiao E, who had four gender dysphoria diagnoses but had not undergone surgery, could change the gender on her ID.However, the Xiao E ruling was the first ever of its kind. It also set no legal precedent, meaning that every person who had not undergone surgery but wanted to change their gender would have to initiate separate legal battles.Nemo told CNA, however, that Xiao E being allowed to change her gender marker without surgery had been a \"ray of light\" for him as his health issues would make major surgery life-threatening.Transgender man Nemo holds up his old ID card alongside his new one, which now lists his gender as male in this CNA file photo.The legal process, however, was still daunting.Nemo submitted one official 'gender dysphoria' diagnosis, as well as a letter from a psychiatrist affirming his gender identity.The Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights (TAPCPR), which provided Nemo and Vivi with pro-bono support, said the court accepted both letters -- and did not demand an additional gender dysphoria diagnosis.However, the legal battle took a severe toll on Nemo's health. At his lowest point, he confided to TAPCPR lawyers that his sole wish was to \"change his ID card before he died.\"Fortunately, his health improved, and he described receiving his updated ID as \"a new chapter\" in his life.He said he hoped his case would help set a precedent -- and help others in similar situations.Vivi's struggleVivi's fight had a different outcome.A daily photo of transgender woman Vivi submitted to the court as “social evidence” of her identity as a woman. Photo courtesy of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership RightsAt court, instead of official diagnoses, she relied on \"social evidence\" -- testimonies from family and friends, photographs depicting her daily life and counseling notes, telling the court that her presence was as \"natural as any cisgender woman's.\"TAPCPR backed her case, advocating for the removal of gender dysphoria diagnoses from legal gender change requirements.However, the court ultimately rejected her request and she has been unable to change her gender marker.In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) depathologized being transgender to help uphold human rights and reduce gender recognition barriers.Chen Yi-chien (陳宜倩), a professor at Shih Hsin University, backed the WHO decision, emphasizing that social interactions and self-perception are key to shaping gender.Identity and recognitionFor many, coming to terms with their gender identity is deeply personal and challenging. For Vivi, it is not just about having official documents, it is about being at peace with herself.She said that counseling has helped her navigate the challenges she has faced and that she now feels able to embrace her identity.Dancing played a role in her journey and helped her explore her feminine side. \"I was finally starting to discover my true self through my body,\" she said. \"And it felt like my body was happy.\"Transgender woman Vivi (right) and Chien Chih-chieh, the secretary-general of the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights chat in front of the Taipei High Administrative Court in July 2024. CNA file photoFor Nemo, hormones were essential. He recalled how he used to nearly argue with his wife because she was so concerned about the impact of the medication on his frail body.But he told CNA that the medication was crucial in helping him feel more masculine.\"When I started to grow a mustache, I saw myself in the mirror and I knew it was the true me.\"Backlash and concernThe court decisions have sparked debate, with safety concerns often cited -- particularly regarding male-to-female transitions.Lin Shu-fan (林書帆), president of the Taiwan Woman Association, said that allowing biological men to change their IDs without surgery could give them access to women-only spaces, such as restrooms, dormitories, bathhouses and prison cells -- potentially endangering the safety and privacy of women.She also criticized transgender expressions that, in her view, often reinforce traditional gender stereotypes. \"Living as a woman often means following gender norms,\" she said. \"But being a woman is not about external things like long hair, lipstick, and skirts.\"However, a 2024 TAPCPR survey found that most transgender people avoid gender-segregated public spaces. Over half felt uncomfortable using public restrooms and nearly a third said they would prefer to endure discomfort.Meanwhile, Chen -- the professor -- highlighted that transgender people are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators.Vivi said she agreed that laws could always be exploited, but argued that forcing all transgender people to undergo major surgery was not the solution. Instead, she urged the government to establish measures to prevent abuse.Legal uncertainty persistsDespite the recent rulings, most people wanting to change the gender marker on their ID card have to undergo gender-affirming surgery, per a 2008 Ministry of the Interior (MOI) directive.This involves the removal of the breasts, uterus and ovaries for transgender men and the removal of the penis and testicles for transgender women. Proof of \"gender dysphoria\" diagnoses from two doctors must also be obtained.However, because this is a directive -- an administrative order issued by a government agency to guide policy implementation -- and not an official law, it has faced criticism from advocates who argue that it violates human rights.In March, TAPCPR petitioned the Control Yuan to revoke the directive, stressing that the lack of clear legislation forces people who don't meet these medical criteria to endure long legal battles with uncertain outcomes.So far, only four others, including Nemo, have won their cases and changed the gender on their IDs without surgery. They all had the two required gender dysphoria diagnoses, apart from Nemo who had one, plus the letter from a psychiatrist.In response, the MOI said it will continue cross-ministry discussions in search of consensus.RecognitionVivi reflected that she was lucky to be surrounded by her supportive mother and friends, which boosted her resilience and helped her mental health.\"Not everyone is so lucky,\" she noted.Vivi (front) leads her students to warm up at her voguing lesson in a Taipei dance studio in August 2024. CNA file photoEven after obtaining an ID that matched his gender identity, Nemo struggled to feel accepted. His family had always been distant and after coming out to his parents, he was told by them never to return home.He said he hopes for more awareness of and basic respect for transgender individuals in Taiwan.Meanwhile, although Vivi has accepted the court's ruling against her, she and the TAPCPR are planning to take her case to the Supreme Administrative Court.She has no plans to submit additional evidence and said she is at peace with the situation.\"Live as your true self, and don't let others define you,\" she said, reflecting on her journey and her hope for a greater understanding of the transgender community.Enditem/kb"

Reincarnation into Another World\" is a flagship production of the 2025 Taiwan Traditional Theatre Festival, organized under the theme \"within/out Boundaries.\"\nFour performances to be held at the Taiwan Traditional Theatre Center in Taipei from May 16-18 have sold out.\nSung and Tsai said they started the project with Liu Biyu's story, brought to them by Taipei National University of the Arts professor Chang Chi-feng (張啟豐), a co-curator of the festival.\nLiu's story was discovered in documents in the National Palace Museum's online archive, notably Emperor Jiaqing's instructions after the criminal -- who profited from forging government documents -- was linked to an uprising against the Qing dynasty, they said.\nThe story ends in mystery after a ship carrying Liu to China \"vanishes\" upon leaving Tainan, Sung and Tsai added.\n\"Everyone has a 'Lord Jiaqing' in their memories -- why not create an alternative world where Jiaqing had visited Taiwan?\" Sung said.\nMeanwhile, Tsai highlighted Sun Tsui-feng sharing the stage with her martial arts actor brother, Sun Jung-hui (孫榮輝), for the first time in over two decades, as one of several nostalgic or intriguing aspects of the production -- alongside the memory of \"Lord Jiaqing\" and the reincarnation storyline playing out in a Taiwanese opera.\nThe reincarnation plot has sparked online discussions among anime fans and attracted younger theatergoers, Tsai said."

Turnover totaled NT$207.66 billion (US$6.4 billion).\n\"Uncertainties created by Trump's tariffs continued to hurt investor confidence,\" equity market analyst Andy Hsu said. \"The worst thing is that few investors were willing to buy on the dip even though the Taiex has fallen sharply in recent sessions. They just wanted to sit back and watch for now.\"\nHsu said large-cap semiconductor stocks continue to lead the broader market lower after contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the most heavily weighted local stock, lost 1.76 percent to close at NT$835.00, contributing about 120 points to the Taiex's fall and sending the electronics index down by 1.60 percent.\n\"Even though TSMC left its sales forecast for 2025 unchanged (at an April 17 investor conference), shrugging off the impact of tariffs, investors just did not buy it, fearing its clients will eventually scale back orders later this year,\" Hsu said.\n\"How Trump will tax semiconductors remains a big concern to the industry,\" he added.\nAmong other semiconductor stocks, TSMC's IC packaging equipment supplier Scientech Corp. shed 3.41 percent to end at NT$241.00, and smartphone IC designer MediaTek Inc. lost 1.47 percent to close at NT$1,345.00. Bucking the downturn, memory chip supplier Nanya Technology Corp. soared 10 percent, the maximum daily increase, to end at NT$38.80 as clients rushed to build up inventories before Trump's announcement on semiconductor duties.\nSecond to TSMC in terms of market value, iPhone and AI server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. rose 0.74 percent to close at NT$136.50, and Quanta Computer Inc., another AI server maker, gained 0.65 percent to end at NT$232.00. \"I suspect government-led funds lent support to these stocks,\" Hsu said.\nTariff worries continued to affect most stocks in the non-tech sector throughout the session, he noted.\nWith the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI) stopping a two-week rising streak last week, the transportation index fell 2.56 percent. Evergreen Marine Corp., the largest container cargo shipper in Taiwan, lost 2.89 percent to close at NT$201.50 and rivals Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp. and Wan Hai Lines Ltd. dropped 3.05 percent and 1.32 percent, respectively, to end at NT$69.90 and NT$82.10.\nAlso in the old economy sector, Eclat Textile Co. lost 2.78 percent to close at NT$367.50, and rival Makalot Industrial Co. shed 5.36 percent to end at NT$247.00. In addition, Formosa Plastics Corp. dropped 2.40 percent to close at NT$34.60, and Formosa Petrochemical Corp. ended down 2.77 percent at NT$24.60.\nThe financial sector appeared resilient, up 0.08 percent with Cathay Financial Holding Co. up 0.93 percent to close at NT$54.10, but Fubon Financial Holding Co. fell 0.63 percent to end at NT$79.00.\n\"It is hard to predict when the Taiex will bottom out as long as tariff concerns are in place,\" Hsu said. \"Investors need to keep as much cash as possible for now.\"\nAccording to the TWSE, foreign institutional investors sold a net NT$1.90 billion worth of shares on the main board Monday."

Everything depends on the result.\"\nThe sole run of the game came after 16 scoreless frames, as the Guardians went hitless in their first four at-bats with runners in scoring position, while the Brothers remained hitless until the seventh inning due to the dominance of Guardians starting pitcher Huang Pao-lo (黃保羅).\nHuang, the Guardians' third overall pick in the 2022 first round, who had just turned 21 on Wednesday, struck out a career-high eight batters during a 6 2/3-inning outing, issuing three walks on 97 pitches. His strong performance outshone Brothers starter Lu Meng-yang (盧孟揚), who also didn't allow a run across six innings.\nHuang flirted with a no-hitter until the bottom of the seventh, when Hsu Chi-hung (許基宏) led off with a double. Huang then retired two batters on groundouts before walking Chiang Kun-yu (江坤宇) -- the last batter he faced.\n\"I actually realized I hadn't given up a hit midway through the game, but I didn't think too much about it because I knew I'd eventually get hit,\" said the right-handed fireballer when asked about his mindset during the near no-hit bid.\nRecalling that his last no-hitter came in junior high, Huang expressed hope for another shot if given the chance.\nHuang, who suspected Hsu may have been targeting his splitter, credited his dominance to efficient pitching and precise pitch location.\nCommenting on Huang's performance, Chen said it was a shame the team did not offer more run support, but praised the young pitcher for showing growing stability and the ability to escape jams.\nCompared with his 2024 season, when he posted a 4.20 ERA over 64.1 innings in 16 games (including 11 starts), Huang has allowed just two runs over 16 2/3 innings in three starts this season, for a 1.08 ERA with 17 strikeouts and no home runs allowed.\nDespite the win, the Guardians remained at the bottom of the six-team CPBL with a 5-11 record, one game behind the Rakuten Monkeys. The Brothers stayed on top at 11-6, half a game ahead of the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions.\nNo games were scheduled on Monday."

    "content": "Taipei, April 21 (CNA) Labor rights groups will make seven demands, including to call for a four-day work week and add public holidays, when they gather for a Labor Day march on May 1 in Taipei, the groups said Monday.\nThe Labor Day 51 Alliance, composed of dozens of Taiwanese labor unions and NGOs, said the march will begin on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office and head down Zhongxiao West Road and Zhongshan South Road before returning to the boulevard.\nThe alliance said it will present seven demands to the government during the march -- which is expected to draw up to 5,000 people -- one of which will focus on reducing the amount of time people in Taiwan work.\nThe alliance said it will call for the Labor Standards Act to be revised to provide more special leave days for employees and gradually get the law changed to allow workers to have three days off a week.\nIt will also push for designating Labor Day as a national holiday, according to Tai Kuo-jung (戴國榮), president of the Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions and chief organizer of the rally.\nAnother of the alliance's hopes is to eliminate workplace bullying, Tai said.\nIt will propose that provisions in the Occupational Safety and Health Act on protecting employees against bullying at work should be applied to both civil servants and workers, he said.\nThe alliance will also suggest that workplace bullying cases be jointly handled by an impartial third party and labor representatives, and that employers should be prohibited form improperly punishing employees who file complaints and victims.\nAnother of the alliance's demands will be to raise employers' monthly mandatory contribution of no less than 6 percent of their employed workers' monthly wages to their labor pension accounts under the new labor pension scheme, Tai said.\nIt will also push for removing the 45-month cap on lump sum pension payment calculations under the old system, Tai said.\nWages will be another of the demands, Tai said. The group will ask for an increase in the minimum monthly salary from NT$28,590 (US$885) to NT$32,000 and for an adjustment in the hourly minimum wage from NT$190 to NT$210 in response to soaring inflation.\nThe alliance will also advocate for better labor rights protection through more effective negotiations between employees and employers and reduce the threshold for organizing labor unions.\nMoreover, it will highlight the importance of taking into account the employment rights of workers in high-emission industries when these industries engage in low-carbon transitions, Tai said.\nThe alliance will also call for addressing staff shortages in sectors like healthcare and nursing, education, and child care, according to Tai."

He was the first Taiwanese artist whose oil paintings were selected by the Japanese Imperial Art Exhibition,\" according to an entry on the IAU's bulletin about the designation.\nNCU Graduate Institute of Astronomy Professor Ip Wing-huen (葉永烜), who suggested the name, told a news conference Monday that the IAU is very strict in its review of proposals for such designations.\nUnderlining the significance of the designation, Ip said the IAU only accepts applications to name astronomical objects after people who have made a significant contribution to the humanities, while rejecting the names of business people, military leaders and politicians, Ip said.\nChen's landscape paintings often reflected a lust for life, but what was more respectable was his pursuit of peace, as a result of which he lost his life, Ip said.\n\"Because of his lust for life and pursuit of peace, we want to remember Mr. Chen Cheng-po not only 78 years later but forever, not only in Taiwan, but in the universe,\" Ip said, referring to Chen's death in 1947.\nThe chairman of the Chen Cheng-po Cultural Foundation is the artist's oldest grandson, Chen Li-po (陳立栢).\nChen Li-po said the foundation will work to figure out how best to use the asteroid's designation to create a positive impact on science, art and cultural spheres.\nA mini-exhibition introducing the Chenchengpo asteroid has been set up at the National Railway Museum alongside the \"Rediscovering Taiwan: Chen Cheng-po's 130th Birthday Anniversary Exhibition,\" which will run until May 11, the Ministry of Culture said in a statement.\nChen Cheng-po was killed during the 228 Incident in 1947, in the aftermath of the then Kuomintang (KMT) regime's brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters across Taiwan.\nChen Cheng-po was chosen as a \"peace negotiator\" with the KMT armed forces. In that capacity he attended what he thought were \"peace talks\" with the military at Chiayi Airport but was instead detained and interrogated. Chen was charged with sedition and publicly executed on March 25, 1947 in front of Chiayi Railway Station."

It was made \"to further maximize opportunities for the development and expansion of the Philippines' priority areas of investment,\" it said.\nThe circular amends the implementation of Executive Order No. 313, issued in 1987 by then-President Corazon Aquino.\nThe 1987 order banned all government officials from visiting Taiwan or officially receiving Taiwanese delegations, as part of Manila's one-China policy that diplomatically recognizes the People's Republic of China over Taiwan, officially named the Republic of China.\nUnder Memorandum Circular 82, the travel ban now applies only to the Philippines' president, vice president, secretary of foreign affairs, and secretary of national defense.\nOther government officials may travel to Taiwan for economic, trade, and investment purposes, but \"they shall travel using their ordinary passports and without using their official titles,\" the circular said.\nBefore visiting Taiwan, they must also inform the de facto Philippines embassy in Taiwan, the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO), and submit a report on their travel to both MECO and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the circular said.\nMemorandum Circular No. 82 also eased the guidelines for Manila in receiving Taiwanese delegations.\nPhilippine government officials and agencies, through MECO, may now host delegations from Taiwan for economic, trade and investment activities.\nThey are also required to notify MECO at least five days before the visit and submit a post-visit report to MECO and the DFA.\nThe circular did maintain some of the restrictions set in 1987, however. It said that no agreements or memoranda of understanding may be signed with \"any Taiwanese organization or agency without clearance from the DFA\" and, when necessary, the Office of the President.\nIn response, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) welcomed the Philippines' renewed guidelines, saying that the latest decision to loosen official exchanges could further enhance bilateral cooperation.\nAccording to MOFA, Taiwan is the Philippines' eighth-largest export market, ninth-largest trade partner and 10th-largest source of imports.\nThe Philippines and Taiwan ended official diplomatic relations in 1975 but continue to maintain close exchanges on many fronts.\nManila is also the third largest source of migrant workers to Taiwan with around 153,000 Philippines in the country as of August 2024."

(TSMC) will form a joint venture with Intel and others to run the American chipmaker's wafer foundry operations, but TSMC Chairman C.C. Wei (魏哲家) denied the rumors at an investor conference last week.\nInternational news media have reported that TSMC, under pressure from the Trump administration's tariffs, will take a stake in the new company to rescue Intel's wafer foundry operations. That has raised concerns over possible leaks of business secrets from TSMC."

    "content": "Taipei, April 22 (CNA) Taiwan's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) on Monday unveiled a comprehensive support package to help agricultural producers and exporters weather the impact of impending U.S. tariffs.\nThe six-measure initiative comes in response to a decision by the Donald Trump administration on April 2 (U.S. time) to impose a 32 percent import duty on all imports from Taiwan, a move that a week later was postponed for 90 days.\nIn its place the U.S. has temporarily imposed a 10 percent tariff on most imports from countries around the world, including Taiwan, with China one of the few exceptions.\nAccording to a statement published on the MOA's website, the measures are designed to stabilize the industry, protect affected producers and enhance Taiwan's competitiveness in both domestic and overseas markets.\nTo cushion the short-term financial impact of tariffs, the ministry said it would subsidize loan interest rates by up to 0.75 percent for a period of six months, with individual loans capped at NT$20 million for eligible farmers, agricultural groups and agribusinesses.\nEligibility will extend to producers with export histories to the United States or those indirectly impacted by tariff adjustments, it said.\nBeyond financing, the government will provide subsidies for cold chain infrastructure, product processing, and quality certification, as part of broader efforts to upgrade production capabilities.\nFlower growers, for instance, will be eligible for subsidies of up to NT$10 million as long as they meet certain conditions, while producers of tea or edamame, a kind of immature soybean popular in East Asian cuisine, will be able to receive targeted support for both equipment and packaging upgrades.\nThe ministry also announced support for branding, packaging innovation and market segmentation, including a subsidy of up to NT$150,000 per project to cover international certification costs for flower, edamame and tea products.\nAquaculture operators, including fish farmers producing barramundi and tilapia, will receive enhanced support for cold storage and ice-making facilities, with subsidy rates increased by 10 percent compared to previous plans.\nSupport will also extend to deep-sea and offshore fishers catching mahi-mahi -- especially those participating in the Fishery Improvement Program (FIP), who will be eligible for upgrades in their cold chain systems of up to NT$3 million per vessel.\nTo ensure continued access to global markets, the MOA will also fund overseas marketing campaigns for Taiwan-grown flowers and seedlings, barramundi, tilapia, mahi-mahi, edamame, and 100 percent domestically produced tea.\nThe MOA noted that detailed application guidelines are now available on its official website and that a free consultation hotline has been established to answer inquiries."

    "content": "Cairo , April 22 (CNA) Egypt may offer a way out of the looming uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy, according to a Taiwanese investor based in the country.\nLo He-chieh (駱和傑), who established Elite Merchandising Corp. (EMC), a textile and ready-made garment factory, in Egypt in 2005, told CNA on Saturday that he received orders for an entire year after Trump announced new reciprocal tariffs on April 2 U.S. time.\nUnder those tariffs, which were postponed a week later, Egypt was among the countries that would face the lowest 10 percent import duty on goods shipped to the United States, compared, for example, to the 32 percent duties planned for goods from Taiwan.\nIn addition to the relatively lower import duties facing Egypt, Lo attributed the surge in sales to his factories' location in Alexandria, one of 20 Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZs) in Egypt that have most benefited the textile and apparel industry.\nAccording to the QIZ protocol signed by Egypt, the United States, and Israel in 2004, textile goods manufactured within the QIZs are exempt from U.S. tariffs as long as at least 11.7 percent of their total value comes from Egypt, the International Trade Administration explained in a 2023 report.\nLo said he moved to Egypt for the opportunities created by the QIZ initiative. The total value of garments produced in his factories includes 10.5 percent of cloth from Israel -- a requirement of the protocol -- and nearly 90 percent of materials and equipment from Asia.\nFASH455, a platform specializing in global apparel and textile trade and sourcing, noted that U.S. import tariff rates for textiles and apparel fluctuated between 13 and 15 percent from 2010 to 2024, compared with an average of just 1 to 3 percent for all goods during the same period.\nAs one of Egypt's oldest industries, the textile and apparel sector contributes around 12 to 15 percent of Egypt's export value and represent the country's third-largest source of foreign exchange.\nAbout 70 percent of the roughly 600 factories in Egypt's QIZs are in the textile and garment sectors.\nHaving expanded his business at the pace of one factory per year, Lo touted EMC as the largest automated garment manufacturer among Egypt's nearly 7,000 garment factories.\nIn addition to Egypt's young and affordable labor force, Lo said the country's location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa -- along with its numerous trade agreements -- makes it a strategic partner that he expects both Washington and Beijing will compete to court.\nOptimistic about Egypt's business potential, Lo encouraged Taiwanese entrepreneurs to invest in the country.\n\"There were only two Taiwanese firms in Egypt when I called on everyone to form a supply chain here. Now, 20 years later, there are still just two,\" he said."

The biggest one, with 1,162 items totaling NT$15.4 billion, consists of spending categories whose funds can be instantly unlocked once a proposal is submitted, Cho said.\nThe second requires the submission of a special report, and funds can only be released after the report has been reviewed by the legislature, Cho said.\nThere are 373 items totaling NT$36.6 billion in this category, the premier said.\nThe third category, meanwhile, has 49 items estimated at NT$86.1 billion, which in itself is broken down into three other parts that require various procedures before they can be unfrozen."

The more pressing problems for Trump, he said, were solving the U.S.' exchange rate crisis and debt crisis, and this could present Taiwan with \"serious challenges.\"\n\"A major crisis will come in June when US$6.5 trillion in U.S. national debt is due. The whole world is watching whether a U.S. national debt crisis will happen,\" Chu warned.\nThat poses a real risk for Taiwan's US$578 billion in foreign exchange reserves, of which 80 percent is U.S. national debt, leaving it particularly susceptible to the economic shock of a failure by the U.S. government to repay the debt, Chu said.\nThe Trump administration initially announced on April 2 U.S. time a 32 percent tariff on imports from Taiwan, with computers, smartphones, and semiconductors later exempted on April 11.\nA week later, the tariffs were then postponed for three months though a basic 10 percent import duty on the goods of most countries was maintained.\nIn response to Trump's tariffs, President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) announced plans to increase investment in the U.S., and his administration endorsed the additional US$100 billion investment in the U.S. pledged by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) in March, Chu said.\nThat has not helped exempt Taiwan from Trump's tariffs, however, Chu argued.\nWith big tech companies including TSMC, Foxconn, and Wistron teaming up with Nvidia to invest US$500 billion in U.S. AI server production, the question for the Lai administration is, \"What are we getting in return?\"\nHuang said the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has yet to put forward an impact assessment report on the tariffs since Trump announced them.\nThe opposition will create an impact assessment platform comprising academics, former economic officials, industry representatives, and local government heads to gauge the impact of the U.S. tariffs over the next six months, Huang said.\nHuang stressed that the deals struck in the government's negotiations with the U.S. must not be inferior to those obtained by Taiwan's main trade competitors, including Japan and South Korea, or the ramifications would be \"catastrophic\" for Taiwan's industrial sector.\nHe said Taiwan should sign a free trade agreement with the U.S. to mitigate the negative impact brought forth by the tariffs.\n\"International trade cannot withstand volatile uncertainties. The opposition will give the ruling party its firmest support in voicing our shared demand to the U.S.: Treat Taiwan as its true ally and sign an FTA,\" he said.\nIn response, DPP spokesperson Justin Wu (吳崢) panned the opposition for \"rumormongering\" by implying that the DPP had not adopted a more proactive stance in addressing the tariff issue.\nAt a news conference at the DPP headquarters, Wu said Lai and Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) have held a series of exchanges with representatives from various sectors since Trump announced the tariffs.\nHe and DPP spokesperson Han Ying (韓瑩) outlined measures laid out by the Cabinet so far, including an NT$88 billion (US$2.7 billion) industry support plan.\nDuring Cho's debrief to the Legislature on April 11, he outlined the expected impact that the tariffs could have on various sectors, but Huang and his TPP colleagues were absent, Wu said.\nIt is \"regrettable\" that the opposition has resorted to a \"mudslinging\" political stunt in the name of unity and public interest, Wu said."

One of the seven, a 15-year-old boy, suffered severe head injuries and was taken to Changhua Christian Hospital.\nThe boy was assessed to have a GCS score of 3, indicating that he is in a deep coma and completely unresponsive. He will be given a CT scan before being transferred into the ICU for treatment, the hospital said.\nThe driver also suffered head injuries in the crash, apparently from hitting the windshield, authorities said.\nBased on a preliminary investigation, the driver who hit the students appears to have fallen asleep at the wheel and veered into oncoming traffic, the Changhua Police Department's Beidou Precinct said.\nThe driver -- who several local news outlets identified as a 40-year-old man surnamed Hsiao (蕭) -- did not have any alcohol in his system, police said.\nA witness of the crash said the car had been driving on the wrong side of the road for around 100 meters, before crashing into the students head-on \"like a bowling ball,\" apparently without hitting the brakes, the Chinese-language United Daily News reported.\nAccording to the police, the group of cyclists included 28 students from Kang Chiao International School in New Taipei, as well as two teachers and one guide.\nThe son of Taipei 101 Chairperson Janet Chia (賈永婕) was one of the cyclists on the trip, but was not injured, Chia confirmed in a statement to the media.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Kang Chiao International School said its principal was en route to Changhua to visit the injured students, and that its teachers and administrators were providing emotional support to students distressed by the crash."

    "content": "Taipei, April 22 (CNA) A Taiwan government-funded program enabling youths from Taiwan's diplomatic allies to participate in cross-cultural exchanges will be officially launched in July, a diplomat in charge of the program's planning said Tuesday.\nThe Taiwan Global Pathfinders Initiative, launched by the government in early 2025, was originally set to offer over 800 opportunities for Taiwanese nationals aged 15 to 30 to travel abroad for durations ranging from two weeks to up to one year.\nThis program focuses on fostering global connections and exchanges among Taiwanese youths.\nNow the government is expanding the program to make it a two-way thing by inviting youths from Taiwan's 12 diplomatic allies to visit the country for short-term stays, said Eric Lin (林世欣), deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA) Department of Policy Planning, during a MOFA weekly briefing Tuesday.\nMOFA is working with TaiwanICDF, a government-funded foreign aid agency, to implement the initiative, Lin said.\nThe initiative will be divided into two programs: one inviting youths from Taiwan's diplomatic allies to visit the country in a two-week trip during which they will experience the nation's unique culture and latest developments under the themes of \"Sustainable Tourism\" and \"Smart Agriculture,\" MOFA said.\nThe two-week program will kick off in July in two batches with a total of 50 vacancies, Lin said.\nThe other part of the initiative would allow up to 25 youths from Taiwan's diplomatic allies to pitch to MOFA on the dreams he or she wishes to fulfill while in Taiwan.\nOnce approved, their Taiwan trips will last longer, from two weeks to no more than three months, starting in September, he added.\nMOFA will be covering all their travels and accommodations during their stays in Taiwan, according to Lin.\nLin said MOFA is now asking its embassies in its 12 diplomatic allies to help promote the initiative. MOFA will also reserve some vacancies for youths from underprivileged families of these allies who have fewer opportunities to travel overseas to join the initiative, he added."

    "content": "Taipei, April 22 (CNA) U.S.-based tech giant Google Inc. has signed an agreement with Denmark's Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) to buy electricity from CIP's wind farm off the coast of Taichung, CIP said Tuesday.\nIn a statement, CIP said through its fifth flagship fund -- Copenhagen Infrastructure V (CI V) -- it and Google signed the Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA) in March to buy power from the Danish dedicated clean energy investment fund manager's Fengmiao I offshore wind project.\nIt is the first agreement Google has made to buy offshore energy in Taiwan as well as in the Asian Pacific region, CIP said.\nLocated about 35 kilometers off the coast of Taichung City, Fengmiao I secured site exclusivity and 500MW grid capacity in Taiwan's Round 3.1 auction and is the first of Taiwan's Round 3 projects to reach financial close as well as start construction.\nIn the statement, Giorgio Fortunato, head of clean energy and power for Asia Pacific at Google, said the CPPA with CIP represented a new chapter for his company as the project will provide reliable electricity to support the firm's data center, cloud region and offices in Taiwan through integration of offshore wind energy development in Taiwan with the company's clean energy efforts.\nFengmiao I will build 33 units of CIP's latest 15MW turbines, CIP said, adding that the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2027.\nFengmiao I, which has secured about NT$103 billion (US$3.16 billion) in financing from 27 international and Taiwanese banks and is gearing up to push for construction, is CIP's third offshore wind project in Taiwan, after the successful construction of Changfang & Xidao and Zhongneng, also in central Taiwan.\nThomas Wibe Poulsen, Partner and Head of Asia-Pacific at CIP, said the agreement with Google regarding the Fengmiao I project is the second power purchasing agreement between the two sides.\nIn December 2024, through CIP's Energy Transition Fund, the two companies signed an agreement to buy renewable energy generated by the Zeevonk project in the Netherlands.\nWhile tapping offshore wind energy in Taiwan, Google announced last week that it has signed a geothermal power purchase agreement with Baseload Power Taiwan to support clean energy development -- its first such deal in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAccording to Google, Taiwan's access to \"substantial geothermal resources\" could complement other renewable sources such as solar and wind, noting the \"significant potential\" for using underground heat to generate clean electricity."

    "date": "2025-04-22",
    "content": "Taipei, April 22 (CNA) Shares in Taiwan extended heavy losses from a session earlier to close down by more than 300 points Tuesday with selling sparked by volatility in the United States, after U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised worries over the independence of the American central bank, dealers said.\nAfter falling 1.49 percent Monday, the Taiex, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), ended down 312.77 points, or 1.64 percent, at 18,793.43 Tuesday, after moving between 18,793.43 and 19,059.65. Turnover totaled NT$243.16 billion (US$7.48 billion).\n\"The sell-off on the U.S. markets showed investors lack confidence in the Trump administration, in particular at a time when the president is threatening Washington's trading partners with tariffs,\" Concord Securities analyst Kerry Huang said.\nHe was referring to the president's criticism of Powell's monetary policy, raising questions about the Fed's independence, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average drop by 2.48 percent overnight.\nThe bellwether electronics sector, which was down 2.02 percent, led the local main board to move lower with large cap semiconductor stocks in focus, Huang said.\n\"Investors appear anxious about how Trump will impose tariffs on semiconductors,\" Huang said. \"For now, they rushed to trim holdings in semiconductor stocks and TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) remained their major target.\"\nContract chipmaker TSMC, the most heavily weighted local stock, shed 2.28 percent to close at the day's low of NT$816.00, contributing more than 150 points to the Taiex's fall.\nAmong other semiconductor stocks, smartphone IC designer MediaTek Inc. lost 3.35 percent to end at NT$1,300.00, and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designer Alchip Technologies Inc. dropped 5.23 percent to close at NT$1,995.00. Bucking the downturn, shares in United Microelectronics Corp., a smaller contract chipmaker, rose 1.49 percent to end at NT$44.30 ahead of an investor conference set to open Wednesday.\n\"In addition to tariffs, Taiwan's tech sector remained haunted by the latest U.S. sanctions on chip exports, including Nvidia's H20 chips, to China so artificial intelligence related stocks came under stiff pressure sending the Taiex even lower,\" Huang said.\nSecond to TSMC in terms of market value, iPhone assembler and AI server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. lost 3.30 percent to close at NT$132.00, and Quanta Computer Inc., another AI server supplier, ended down 3.66 percent to end at NT$223.50.\nWith tech heavyweights in the doldrums, select large cap old economy stocks appeared resilient, Huang said. \"But, that was technical in nature based on their relatively low valuations,\" he said.\nAmong them, Nan Ya Plastics Corp. rose 1.33 percent to close at NT$30.45, while Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. ended down 0.20 percent at NT$24.55. In addition, food brand Uni-President Enterprises Corp. rose 0.94 percent to close at NT$75.40, and Standard Foods Corp. gained 0.15 percent to end at NT$33.35.\nIn the financial sector, which fell 1.40 percent, Cathay Financial Holding Co. shed 2.24 percent to close at NT$77.30, and Fubon Financial Holding Co. lost 2.15 percent to end at NT$50.50, while Mega Financial Holding Co. closed unchanged at NT$37.70.\n\"The Taiex remains in consolidation mode and if there is any rebound, profit taking could follow amid the current fragile sentiment,\" Huang said.\nAccording to the TWSE, foreign institutional investors sold a net NT$5.24 billion worth of shares on the main board Tuesday."

Turnover totaled NT$269.098 billion (US$8.28 billion).\nThe point gain in the Taiex was the second highest on record, trailing only a 1,608.27-point spike on April 10 after U.S. President Donald Trump suspended for 90 days most of the draconian \"reciprocal\" tariffs he announced on April 2 (U.S. time).\n\"Today's upturn was completely driven by news that encouraged investors to think trade friction between Washington and Beijing is easing,\" Mega International Investment Services analyst Alex Huang said.\nHe was referring to an interview in which U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected \"there will be a de-escalation\" in Trump's trade war with China in the \"very near future.\"\nBessent's remarks boosted the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 2.66 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index by 2.71 percent overnight.\n\"Now, U.S. stock futures are continuing the uptrend, pointing to a higher opening later today,\" Huang said. \"It was no surprise that the Taiex staged a strong rebound, led by large cap electronics stocks.\"\nAfter a 2.39 percent rise in its American depositary receipts (ADRs) overnight, contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) surged 6.99 percent to close at NT$873.00.\nThat contributed about 460 points alone to the Taiex's gains and helped the electronics index move higher by 5.67 percent.\nThe buying in TSMC spread to other semiconductor stocks.\nIC packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. soared 7.84 percent to end at NT$137.50, and smartphone IC designer MediaTek Inc. rose 5.38 percent to close at NT$1,370.00.\nTSMC's IC assembly equipment supplier Scientech Corp. rose 10 percent, the maximum daily increase, to end at NT$264.00.\nArtificial intelligence related stocks also attracted strong interest.\nAI server maker and iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, rose 5.30 percent to close at NT$139.00, and AI graphics card vendor Giga-Byte Technology Co. ended up 5.26 percent at NT$220.00.\nHuang said bargain hunters turned active throughout the session after recent heavy losses, with non-tech stocks also helped by the news that trade war tensions could ease.\nIn the old economy sector, Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. gained 3.26 percent to close at NT$25.35, and Formosa Plastics Corp. rose 2.89 percent to end at NT$35.65.\nIn addition, King's Town Construction Co. grew 4.89 percent to close at NT$47.20 and Goldsun Building Materials Co. added 3.53 percent to end at NT$39.55.\nThe financial sector rose 1.37 percent, with Fubon Financial Holding Co. up 2.59 percent to close at NT$79.30, E.

    "content": "Taipei, April 23 (CNA) Taiwan needs to streamline the application process for new undersea cables to \"encourage more investment,\" while also prioritizing the protection of critical underwater infrastructure against China's \"gray zone\" threats, the head of the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC) said Wednesday.\nIn his keynote speech at the TWNIC Engagement Forum in Taipei, TWNIC Chairman Kenny Huang (黃勝雄)said that Taiwan \"currently has only 14 [international] submarine cables, with one or two more in the pipeline -- but can we encourage more investment for submarine cables?\"\nIn a previous interview with CNA, Huang described Taiwan's 14 international and 10 domestic undersea communication cables -- which carry 99 percent of the country's internet traffic -- as a \"digital lifeline.\"\nWhile the international cables are mostly built through joint ventures involving multiple global companies, all domestic cables are owned and operated by Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan's largest telecom service provider, according to the Ministry of Digital Affairs, which oversees the nonprofit organization TWNIC.\nHuang said there are \"a lot of processes\" involved in applying to set up a new undersea cable, whether by international or domestic companies, with approval required from multiple government agencies, including the National Communications Commission, the Ministry of the Interior, and even the Ministry of Culture (MOC).\nA presentation slide shown by Huang indicated that the approval process for an application to conduct an underwater cultural heritage survey takes around eight months at the MOC, while approval of the completed report can take up to 12 months.\nThe same slide also showed that Taiwan's application for permits to system inspection takes an average of 29 months, more than double the Asia-Pacific regional average of 14 months.\n\"The review process includes many unnecessary steps,\" Huang said, citing the example of the underwater cultural heritage survey, which he suggested could instead be submitted only if underwater heritage is actually discovered, a practice adopted by other countries in the region, such as Japan, the Philippines, and Australia.\nHuang also touched on the protection of critical underwater infrastructure (CUI), which includes power cables, oil pipelines, and undersea communication cables, spanning from Taiwan's 12-nautical-mile territorial waters to its 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and further into the high seas.\nHuang said \"new capabilities\" are needed, as the underwater domain is a natural theater for \"gray zone\" actions.\n\"One moment, nothing seems to be happening, and the next, the entire cable is gone -- and you wouldn't even see it happen,\" Huang said. \"There are too many vehicles and tools capable of carrying out such an operation, including unmanned vehicles and uncrewed vessels,\" he added.\nHe said a full digital model of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) based on sonar imaging could be used to monitor the undersea domain, \"because underwater, the only available tool is sonar.\"\nThe model could be developed based on Taiwan's territorial waters if costs are a concern, Huang added.\nAsked by CNA whether Taiwan can currently defend its CUI, Huang said that the government should develop a national strategy to protect CUI, with priorities set according to available resources.\nTaiwan has experienced several incidents in recent years where its undersea communication cables were either damaged by natural causes or deliberately cut, temporarily disrupting internet connectivity.\nLocal authorities have characterized some of these incidents as Chinese \"gray zone\" tactics, referring to provocative or aggressive actions that fall short of open conflict.\nEarlier this month, Tainan prosecutors indicted the Chinese captain of a Togolese-registered vessel suspected of deliberately severing an undersea communication cable linking Taiwan and Penghu in late February."

According to one of his Facebook posts, 30 of the 500-plus loans had been paid off early.\nOn Wednesday, Lin was introduced to Nomfundo Mabuza from Eswatini's Lubombo Region, one of the first recipients of the Taiwan-funded loans, and he met her baby girl named \"Taiwan.\"\nLin presented the child with a gift of a leopard cat shaped pillow that featured the critically endangered endemic species in Taiwan, according to one of his Facebook posts.\nIn March 2024, Mabuza received a loan of 20,000 Eswatini dollars (US$1,150) from the women's startup fund, which she used to buy high-quality corn and vegetable seeds, according to TaiwanICDF, the government-funded agency in charge of foreign aid.\nAfter harvesting her corn and vegetables, Mabuza sold them for more than 50,000 Eswatini dollars, and by September 2024, she had repaid the loan in full, TaiwanICDF said.\nWhen Mabuza gave birth to a baby girl in March this year, she named the child \"Taiwan,\" in recognition of the \"life-changing\" support she had received through the Taiwan-funded loan, according to the agency.\nLin's current visit to Eswatini, Taiwan's only diplomatic ally in Africa, is his first in his capacity as foreign minister. The main purpose of the visit is to attend King Mswati III's 57th birthday celebrations on behalf of President Lai Ching-te (賴清德).\nIn March, Eswatini Home Affairs Minister Princess Lindiwe said that the main celebrations of King Mswati III's 57th birthday would be held on April 25 in the kingdom's Shiselweni Region.\nTaiwan, officially named the Republic of China, established formal diplomatic ties with the Kingdom of Eswatini on Sept. 6, 1968, when the landlocked nation in southern Africa gained full independence from the United Kingdom.\nEswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is the last absolute monarchy in Africa and the only country on the continent that formally recognizes Taiwan."

Wei (魏哲家) hosted the opening ceremony in Santa Clara for the company's flagship customer event of the year, which drew registrations from more than 2,500 attendees.\n\"Representing a significant advancement from TSMC's industry-leading N2 process,\" the A14 logic process technology is designed to drive AI transformation \"by delivering faster computing and greater power efficiency,\" TSMC said in a statement on Thursday.\nTSMC's current A14 development is progressing smoothly, with its yield performance ahead of schedule, and the process is expected to enter production in 2028, according to the statement.\nCompared to the N2 process, which is about to enter volume production later this year, the A14 could offer up to a 15 percent speed improvement at the same power level, or it could reduce power consumption by up to 30 percent at the same speed, TSMC said.\nIn addition, the company said, it continues to advance its Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) technology for high-performance computing applications to address AI's enormous need for more logic and high-bandwidth memory (HBM).\nTSMC also said it plans to bring its 9.5 reticle size CoWoS to volume production in 2027.\nAfter showcasing its revolutionary System-on-Wafer (SoW) technology in 2024, TSMC on Wednesday unveiled its SoW-X, a CoWoS-based platform to create a wafer-sized system, which has computing power 40 times greater than the current CoWoS solution, with mass production planned for 2027.\nIn addition, the company also debuted new logic, specialty, advanced packaging, and 3D chip stacking technologies, which it said will contribute to broad technology platforms for high-performance computing (HPC), smartphone, automotive, and Internet of Things (IoT).\nThese include the N4C RF, the latest generation of TSMC's radio frequency technology, designed to meet the requirements of emerging standards such as WiFi8 and AI-enabled True Wireless Stereo platforms. The N4C RF is scheduled to enter risk production in the first quarter of 2026, according to the company."

    "date": "2025-04-24",
    "content": "Taipei, April 24 (CNA) A majority of people in Taiwan support physician-assisted dying in cases involving terminal illness, long-term physical pain, and severe cognitive impairment, according to a study by National Taiwan University's College of Public Health.\n\"While many diseases remain incurable, advances in medical technology have made it possible to delay their progression, resulting in prolonged life,\" said Chen Duan-rung (陳端容), a professor at the college's Institute of Health Behaviors and Community Sciences, at a news conference in Taipei Thursday.\n\"However, such life extension often leaves patients in long-term pain, disability, or even a state lacking dignity,\" she said, adding that more and more Western countries are beginning to recognize an individual's right to decide when and how to end their own life.\nThose methods include euthanasia, a process that requires medical personnel to carry out the final act -- such as administering a lethal injection -- and physician-assisted dying, in which the patient takes the final action themselves, Chen explained, noting that both are currently illegal in Taiwan.\nTo understand whether the public in Taiwan supports the right to physician-assisted dying and what factors may influence their views, Chen and her team conducted an online survey of 3,992 Taiwanese adults in 2022, the results of which were published in the medical journal BMJ Open in January.\nParticipants were asked whether they supported allowing patients to request physician-assisted dying under three scenarios: 86.2 percent supported it for patients with terminal illness and unrelievable long-term physical pain, 79.6 percent for patients with non-terminal but incurable illness causing prolonged pain, and 72.6 percent for patients with severe cognitive impairment and incurable diseases.\nAmong all respondents, 67.6 percent supported granting patients the right to request physician-assisted dying in all three scenarios, the study showed.\nBased on the survey results, Chen said that support for physician-assisted dying was higher among young adults (aged 20 - 39), males, those without religious beliefs, and individuals who work as caregivers.\n\"Caregivers are on the front lines caring for patients or the elderly,\" Chen said, adding that the higher level of support for physician-assisted dying among caregivers may stem from their \"empathy and understanding of patients' suffering\" through long-term interactions with them.\nChen, however, noted that healthcare professionals, including doctors and nurses, tended not to support physician-assisted dying in any of the three scenarios, likely due to ethical concerns and legal considerations tied to their professional responsibilities.\nThe study also assessed participants' awareness of the Patient Right to Autonomy Act (PRAA) -- which allows patients with conditions such as terminal illness the right to refuse futile life-prolonging treatments and opt for a \"natural death\" -- as well as their preparedness for Advance Care Planning (ACP), a proactive approach to making end-of-life care decisions in advance.\nOnly 37.3 percent of respondents were aware that the PRAA had been implemented, and those who were aware tended to be less supportive of physician-assisted dying, Chen said, noting that in contrast, most physician-assisted dying supporters were unaware that the law was already in place.\n\"The PRAA grants terminally ill patients, as well as those in a deep coma or with advanced dementia, the right to a natural death, but does not permit them to choose an accelerated one,\" Chen said, adding that greater awareness of the PRAA may reduce public support for physician-assisted dying.\nFor individuals with a higher level of ACP, Chen said that they are \"more open to discussions about death and end-of-life decisions,\" and thus more accepting of physician-assisted dying.\nIn terms of the study's impact, Chen said that the research team hopes it can serve as a \"foundation\" for future public and ethical discussions on physician-assisted dying.\n\"It [the study] reflects that many people in Taiwan fear a life worse than death, are willing to accept 'end-of-life autonomy,' and are becoming more open to the idea of 'dying with dignity,'\" she said."

He was transferred to NTUH on Wednesday.\nThe school said that two other students with serious injuries were also transferred to Taipei for treatment, while four others hit by Hsiao's car have returned home after receiving treatment in Changhua.\nDespite the collision on Tuesday, some members of the group continued the cycling tour around the island, the school said, adding that they expect to complete their trip on Friday as originally planned."

Security Council meeting convened by the PRC on Wednesday U.S. time at U.N. headquarters in New York, according to a transcript issued by the mission.\nCiting the Concept Note of the round of meeting titled \"The Impact of Unilateralism and Bullying Practices on International Relations\" which called for opposition to \"all forms of unilateralism and bullying,\" Wu said the U.S. is critical of China's \"misuse of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758,\" according to the transcript.\nWu spoke of China's \"misuse of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758 in its attempts to isolate Taiwan, mischaracterize other countries' policies, and constrain their choices.\"\n\"This resolution does not preclude Taiwan's meaningful participation in the U.N. system and other multilateral fora,\" Wu said, according to the transcript.\n\"Working closely with our allies and partners, the United States will continue to counter Beijing's goals of embedding its authoritarian principles here at the United Nations,\" Wu added.\nIn response to Wu's comments, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Thursday expressed Taipei's gratitude to Washington over the Taiwan-friendly statement.\nThis is the first time the U.S. has raised the issue during a U.N. Security Council meeting, MOFA said in a press release.\nThe last time the Donald Trump administration criticized the PRC's misuse of the U.N. resolution was in February during the World Health Organization's 156th session of the Executive Board, MOFA noted.\nResolution 2758 was adopted by the 26th U.N.

    "content": "Taipei, April 25 (CNA) More than eight out of 10 Taiwanese continue to disagree with Beijing's \"one country, two systems\" stance on dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait relations, according to the latest survey released by the Mainland Affairs Council on Thursday.\nThe poll found that 84.4 percent of respondents oppose the \"one country, two systems\" concept, in line with past answers obtained by the quarterly MAC survey.\nOver the past three years, the percentage of respondents opposing \"one country, two systems\" has consistently remained between a low of 83.6 percent, seen in April 2023, and a high of 89.6 percent, seen in April 2024.\nIn the most recent survey, 82.5 percent of respondents rejected China's claim that \"Taiwan is a part of China's territory and has never been a country\" and 80.6 percent disagreed with China's insistence on the \"one-China\" principle.\nAt the same time, 79.1 percent supported the view that the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC, China) do not belong to each other, another result that mirrored previous surveys.\nSupport for that proposition has vacillated between around 74 percent and a peak of 82.2 percent in May 2022 over the past three years, even if it has been more widely articulated publicly since President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) took office in May 2024.\nWhen respondents were asked toward the current cross-strait status, more than 85 percent favored maintaining the status quo.\nThis included 36 percent who preferred to keep the status quo permanently, 25.9 percent who wanted to decide Taiwan's future at a later time, and 19.9 percent who supported maintaining the status quo for now but ultimately favor independence.\nRegarding China's influence operations in Taiwan, 73.7 percent of respondents believed that the Chinese Communist Party is intensifying its infiltration of Taiwanese society, while 70.9 percent supported requiring all elected representatives, including lawmakers, to obtain government permission before engaging with China.\nIn addition, 56.9 percent of respondents said that when Chinese nationals apply to enter Taiwan, the government should consider whether they are linked to China's unification strategy.\nThe survey also addressed recent controversies in Taiwanese society, including the revocation of residence permits for two Chinese spouses of Taiwanese citizens who allegedly advocated for China's annexation of Taiwan.\nOn this issue, 67.8 percent of respondents supported the government's decision to revoke the individuals' residence permits and deport them.\nMeanwhile, 70.9 percent of respondents said the Beijing government is \"unfriendly\" toward Taipei, compared to just 15.5 percent who considered it \"friendly.\"\nThe survey was conducted by National Chengchi University's Election Study Center via telephone interviews from April 17 to 21. It collected 1,099 valid samples from respondents aged 20 or older and had a margin of error of 2.96 percentage points."

    "date": "2025-04-25",
    "content": "Washington, April 24 (CNA) As cases of Chinese espionage emerge, Taiwan must respond by \"depoliticizing\" the issue and recognize the fact that anyone could potentially become a spy for China, according to a U.S. analyst on Thursday.\nThere is a need to \"recognize that anyone can be a victim. Anyone can make that choice. It doesn't matter where they come from,\" Peter Mattis, former counterintelligence analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, said during a seminar organized by the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington, D.C.\nThere were people who worked for the Kuomintang and national security organizations, while there were also individuals on the Democratic Progressive Party side who \"have chosen to spy for some reason or another,\" Mattis said.\nHe went on to cite a recent case of alleged espionage involving a former assistant who worked for National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu (吳釗燮), during Wu's tenure as Taiwan's Foreign Minister from 2018 to 2024.\n\"This is why, to me, it is a tragedy that you have an aide to Wu Chao-hsieh [Joseph Wu], or that you have someone who worked in the Legislative Yuan for so long, who was spying for the CCP [Chinese Communist Party],\" he said.\nCiting Deng Xiaoping's (鄧小平) famous \"black cat, white cat\" quote, the former CIA analyst said: Whether it is \"a blue spy, green spy, white spy, it doesn't matter what kind of spy, as long as it hurts Taiwan, it's a good spy.\"\nHe suggested that Taiwan handle the situation with great caution and work to establish some objective standards of behavior and security procedures that \"allow people to have a clear set of expectations, what's acceptable, what's not, and also the rules to remove people from sensitive positions.\"\nBesides the issue of espionage, Mattis raised concerns about the Chinese military's recent training at a firing range in Inner Mongolia that simulated the surroundings of Taiwan's Presidential Office in Taipei.\nAccording to Mattis, the CCP has been placing a persistent focus on Taiwan's military police command and, therefore, presidential security.\n\"This, to me, is quite concerning, because there is an importance of a national leader, and this is a very clear and deliberate effort to make sure that they have real-time awareness of the president's security detail,\" he said.\nThe two-hour-long seminar titled \"Enhancing US-Taiwan Cooperation in Countering the CCP's Ideological Work and Political Warfare\" also saw other key speakers, including Mike Studeman, former Commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence and a retired rear admiral, and Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at RAND."

    "date": "2025-04-25",
    "content": "Taipei, April 25 (CNA) The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) on Friday lowered Taiwan's 2025 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast to 2.91 percent, due to rising uncertainty for the second half of the year.\nThe economic think tank said in a report that the adjustment of economic growth from 3.42 percent predicted in January is due partly to the upward adjustment of economic growth by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, raising the base rate.\nAnother reason is the volatility of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies.\nAfter reciprocal tariffs were announced on April 2, Trump made an abrupt turn one week later and announced a 90-day pause on the policy, with tariffs of 10 percent to be implemented in the meantime.\nThis resulted in companies stocking up on inventory in advance before the higher tariff rates are implemented, the TIER said.\nIn the first quarter, Taiwan's imports, exports, manufacturing output, and export orders all performed strongly, driven by high demand for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and inventory stocking by businesses, TIER said.\nHowever, TIER Economic Forecasting Center Director Gordon Sun (孫明德) said that the 90-day halt of the tariffs has raised uncertainty, and the current frenzied manufacturing and purchasing activities are essentially dipping into the future.\nAs the stockpiling dies down, foreign demand will decline in the second half of the year, the TIER said.\nIn addition, as the global economy slows, the financial market will fluctuate. Recent poor stock performances will result in a reverse wealth effect and dampen consumer sentiment, according to the TIER.\nTherefore, the TIER has lowered private investment growth by 1.56 percentage points to 4.1 percent and private consumption growth by 0.14 percentage points to 1.97 percent.\nTIER President Chang Chien-yi (張建一) said that future development of the tariff policies is highly unpredictable, so the prediction was based on reciprocal tariffs being 10 percent and the expectations that global growth would slow.\nThe TIER has listed four main uncertainties in 2025 that will influence Taiwan's trade, investment and consumption, including the range and schedule of U.S. tariffs, the monetary policies of major countries, China's economic performance under escalating trade conflicts, and whether the global AI enthusiasm will continue.\nSun also warned that Trump may wage currency wars next.\nThis will result in different outcomes in currency value in Asian countries, where currencies in countries trading more frequently with China, compared with the U.S. -- including Singapore and Malaysia -- will move with the Chinese yuan and depreciate, whereas Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam may see their currencies appreciate, Sun said.\nThe differences will greatly affect businesses' export competitiveness, he added.\nSun cautioned Taiwanese businesses to hedge against the possible appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar."

The walkout was eventually launched on June 20 that same year.\nIn response, the company filed a civil lawsuit against the union, claiming that the strike action was illegal and caused a huge financial loss to the company as well as damage to its reputation because of interruptions to passengers' travel plans.\nThe strike officially ended on July 10 that year after the airline signed an agreement with TFAU to improve working conditions, although it did not drop the suit against the union.\nIn March 2022, the case was heard by the Taipei District Court, which ruled the strike action lawful under the Act for Settlement of Labor-Management Disputes.\nThe court also said it did not find that the union had engaged in what the carrier alleged were improper actions, such as organizing the strike or making excessive demands.\nEVA Airways later filed an appeal, but the ruling was subsequently upheld by the Taiwan High Court. Another appeal was again filed by the company, but was rejected by the Supreme Court."

The KMT's Taipei chapter office was also raided by prosecutors that day.\nThe district court, however, only granted prosecutors' motion to detain two KMT staffers on April 18, but released Huang Lu and another KMT staffer without bail after finding insufficient evidence to keep them in custody.\nKMT Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫), who led protests close to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office for two evenings on April 17-18 until Huang Lu left the court on the morning of April 19, said on Friday that he will ask the lawyers to do whatever they can to help Huang Lu, and file an appeal.\nChu said prosecutors' appeal of the district court's initial decision shows they are determined to detain Huang Lu, and called that a \"typical\" manipulation of the judicial system by the DPP.\nThe DPP's targeting of opposition parties would not be able to hold back people's voice of anger, Chu said, urging everyone to take part in the KMT's planned protest on Saturday to \"defend\" Taiwan's democracy.\nThe DPP, on the other hand, questioned the legitimacy of the KMT's protest, which is scheduled to take place in front of the Presidential Office building in Taipei.\nDuring a news conference in Taipei on Friday, DPP Spokesperson Justin Wu (吳崢) called the KMT's accusations of the judicial system a tactic to shift attention away from what the party is being investigated for -- the petitions submitted with forged signatures to initiate recall of DPP lawmakers.\nWu said the fact that the KMT can hold a large political gathering on Saturday proves that Taiwan is a free and democratic society."

    "content": "Taipei, April 26 (CNA) Starting May 7, documents declaring the origin of products made in Taiwan for export to the United States will be required, to prevent items produced elsewhere from using Taiwan as a transit channel to evade higher tariffs imposed by Washington, according to the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).\nExporters who fail to submit a signed declaration of origin will face a fine of up to NT$3 million (US$92,164), according to the ITA.\nIn a statement, the ITA said that after the Trump administration on April 2 imposed varying levels of \"reciprocal tariffs\" on countries with a high trade surplus with Washington, manufacturers in other countries could be tempted to change the origin of their products and use Taiwan as a transshipment channel to shun heavier tariffs.\nTaiwan faces a 32 percent tariff, whereas other countries in the region have been slapped with higher levels, including 46 percent for Vietnam and 37 percent for Thailand.\nAfter the April 2 announcement, the U.S. president announced a 90-day pause on the new tariffs on April 9, deciding instead to apply a 10 percent baseline duty to most countries except for China, which faces up to 245 percent tariffs on certain imports.\nThe ITA said the signed declaration of origin is expected to prevent manufacturers in other countries from taking advantage of Taiwan by simply repackaging or reprocessing their products before shipping them to the U.S. market.\nIf preventative actions are not taken, the ITA said, Taiwan could see its international credit, reputation, and chances of seeking a tariff cut during its negotiations with the U.S. diminished.\nThe ITA emphasized that the requirement for a signed declaration of product origin is not aimed at restricting Taiwanese exporters at all. Instead, the agency hopes they would collaborate with the government to close any loopholes, which is expected to protect Taiwan's interests in international trade and economic development.\nCiting the Foreign Trade Act, the ITA said violators will face a warning, a fine ranging from NT$60,000 to NT$3 million, and the harshest penalty - revocation of their exporter and importer licenses.\nThe ITA said that since the method of determining the origin of a product is different in Taiwan and the U.S., exporters have been advised to apply with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for an advance review of the origin of their products to protect their interests.\nIn addition, the ITA said Taiwanese companies should communicate with their American buyers about the origin before shipping products to the U.S. market.\nMeanwhile, the MOEA held a forum on Friday to help about 3,000 Taiwanese exporters, including those in the machinery and machine tools industries, understand how to meet the requirements.\nAt the forum, American lawyers who specialize in cases involving the origin of products were invited by the MOEA to share their understanding of how the U.S. Customs determines the origin of products.\nThe ITA cited U.S. lawyers as saying the U.S. Customs usually figures out the origin of products on a case-by-case basis."

The other six were released after questioning.\nAccording to the statement, they allegedly engaged in insider trading during a blackout period in 2021 after learning that the two companies had confirmed imminent business moves.\nThe case stems from the settlement of a nearly decade-long legal dispute over intellectual property infringement between the two companies, which concluded in 2021 when Largan acquired a 15.2 percent stake in Ability for NT$598 million.\nProsecutors said they were first notified of the case by the Investigation Bureau in September 2024 and subsequently launched an investigation, which they noted is still ongoing.\nIn separate statements issued Friday, the two companies said the investigation has not impacted their financial status and pledged to fully cooperate with the authorities."

    "content": "Taipei, April 26 (CNA) S&P Global has affirmed its \"AA+\" long-term and \"A-1+\" short-term credit ratings for Taiwan, saying geopolitical unease is not expected to affect the local manufacturing sector's development over the long run.\nIn a statement released earlier this week, the ratings agency said Taiwan's outlook over the long term is stable, which reflects its expectation that \"structural demand for Taiwan's semiconductor exports is likely to offset growth issues associated with longstanding geopolitical tensions and evolving trade settings\" over the next 24 months.\nS&P said its ratings on Taiwan were maintained based on the country's \"robust external position\" and \"strong economic support.\"\nDespite current uncertainties relating to global trade, S&P said, Taiwan is expected to continue to benefit from a strong export performance amid global advancement in the information technology sector, with Taiwan's growth prospects being stronger than its peers' at a similar income level.\nWhile its spending on defense and social benefits has risen and is likely to continue to grow, \"Taiwan's fiscal settings remain healthy, supported by strong revenue growth.\" In addition, \"ample domestic liquidity and low debt-servicing costs further contribute to the government's fiscal strength,\" it said.\nS&P said it believes cross-strait ties will not deteriorate toward a major military conflict given the close economic and trade ties between China and Taiwan.\nThe ratings agency said Taiwan's monetary flexibility is also strong.\n\"The central bank has demonstrated sound monetary management, which has kept inflation low and stable despite ample liquidity in the system,\" S&P said. \"The relatively flexible exchange rate and the new Taiwan dollar being an actively traded currency help cushion economic and financial shocks.\"\nThe United States imposed a 32 percent \"reciprocal\" tariff on Taiwan on April 2 but subsequently announced a 90-day pause with a 10 percent baseline tariff remaining in place.\nCommenting on the tariffs, S&P said the initial tariffs would have a substantial impact on Taiwan's growth due to its export-oriented economy, particularly as 18 percent of its trade is with the U.S.\n\"However, we believe Taiwan's credit metrics have sufficient buffers against such an economic shock\" S&P said.\" Furthermore, it has a leadership position in advanced chip manufacturing, moderating the impact of U.S. tariffs as importers have limited scope to diversify their supplier base.\"\nS&P praised Taiwan's vibrant and highly competitive electronics manufacturing sector, saying the sector is well positioned to benefit from long-term developments in the technology-intensive integrated circuit industry, as demand for chips is likely to remain high on the back of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing devices, 5G network deployment, big data processing and analytics, and electric vehicle development."

    "date": "2025-04-26",
    "content": "Taipei, April 26 (CNA) Business sentiment in the local manufacturing sector which has been adversely impacted by the Trump administration's tariff policies weakened in March, according to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).\nData compiled by TIER, one of the leading think tanks in Taiwan, showed the composite index gauging business sentiment among local manufacturers fell 2.71 points from a month earlier to 95.00 in March, the lowest level in five months.\nTIER's composite index assessing business sentiment in Taiwan's service sector also move lower by 4.50 from a month earlier to 88.51, the lowest level in almost five years, while its composite index for the construction industry shed 7.53, dropping to 94.34, the lowest in nearly two years, the data indicated.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats have created uncertainties in the global economy and could hinder demand from end-users, slow the pace of industries in expansion and even hurt the real estate market, TIER said.\nCiting a survey conducted in March, 34.0 percent of respondents said their business improved in the month, up from 29.5 percent in a similar poll conducted in February, while 21.7 percent of said their business deteriorated in March, down from 23.9 percent in February.\nThe results largely reflected an increase in rush orders as foreign buyers scrambled to build up their inventories to avoid Trump's tariffs, TIER added.\nThe March survey also found 19.7 percent of respondents believe their business will improve over the next six months, down sharply from 35.1 percent in February, while 29.8 percent said their business will deteriorate over the next six months, up significantly from 12.6 percent in February.\nThe results over the next six months showed manufacturers' pessimism amid uncertainties created by tariffs, TIER said.\nCommenting on the service sector, TIER said volatility on the local equity market made the securities industry very cautious as many investors fear Taiwan will face retaliation from the United States given its large trade surplus with Washington. In 2024, Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. hit US$73.9 billion.\nOn April 2, Trump announced \"reciprocal\" tariffs on countries that have a large trade surplus with Washington, including Taiwan, which was slapped with a 32 percent tariff. The White House announced a 90-day pause on the new measures later, with a 10 percent duty applied to all countries except China.\nMeanwhile, Liu Pei-chen (劉佩真), a researcher at TIER's Taiwan Industry Economics Database, said the local home market has been in the doldrums, with heavy losses in the stock market, geopolitical tensions and uncertainties in the economy adding downward pressure to the real estate market.\nTransactions of homes are expected to shrink and in certain areas where supply is high and home prices could face downward pressure, although prices in most of Taiwan are unlikely to move lower sharply due to high land costs, carbon fee charges and a labor shortage, Liu said."

    "content": "Taipei, April 26 (CNA) The main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), said Saturday that it will push for a motion in the Legislature to recall President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) after May 20, the first anniversary of Lai's inauguration, during a rally in Taipei that the KMT claimed attracted 250,000 supporters.\nSince taking office last year, Lai has focused not on good governance but on eliminating opposition parties, KMT Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) said at a rally organized by the KMT in Taipei on Saturday afternoon.\n\"This dictator [referring to Lai] is carrying out a Cultural Revolution in Taiwan -- a green [the color that denotes the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, DPP] Cultural Revolution aimed at eliminating all dissent,\" he said.\nChu said Lai is \"more communist than the communists, more fascist than the fascists,\" adding that if Lai refuses to \"repent,\" the people of Taiwan will launch a nationwide recall of him starting from May 20.\n\"How about letting the Legislature propose a recall motion [against Lai] immediately after May 20?\" said Chu, whose KMT, together with the smaller opposition Taiwan People's Party (TPP), holds a majority in the Legislative Yuan.\nWhile acknowledging that the recall motion against Lai can only be passed with a two-thirds majority in the Legislature -- as the combined seats of the KMT and TPP lawmakers is not enough to pass such a motion -- Chu said the KMT will seek to mobilize people across Taiwan to \"use their collective strength to bring Lai down.\"\nAccording to the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act, a recall motion against the president and vice president must be proposed by one-fourth of all legislators and approved by two-thirds of the legislature before it can be put to a popular vote.\nIn the 113-seat Legislature, opposition parties hold 62 seats - including 52 from the Kuomintang (KMT), 8 from the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), and 2 independents. This means the opposition camp is still 14 votes short of being able to pass a recall motion.\nChu was speaking at a rally organized by the KMT on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office Building, titled \"Fight Green Communism, Resist Dictatorship.\"\nThe two-hour rally was attended by both KMT and TPP supporters, with organizers announcing that the total number of participants exceeded 250,000 by the end of the event.\nOther KMT and TPP lawmakers and leaders, including Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜) of the KMT and TPP Chairman Huang Kuo-chang (黃國昌), also took to the stage to deliver remarks to the crowd standing in the rain, criticizing the DPP led by Lai.\n\"Launching a recall campaign against a legislator right after they are elected -- what kind of ruling party does that? This is not how democracy is supposed to work,\" Han said, referring to the ongoing recall campaigns targeting KMT lawmakers across Taiwan.\n\"Democracy must have checks and balances provided by opposition parties,\" Han said, adding that while Lai and the DPP often tout Taiwan's democracy to foreign countries, they are \"murdering democracy\" at home.\nIn the same vein, Huang said Lai had launched the recall campaigns targeting KMT lawmakers as part of his push for \"great dictatorship,\" saying, \"We will never allow the DPP government or Lai Ching-te to lead Taiwan back down the old path of authoritarian rule.\"\nAmong those chanting slogans such as \"Lai Ching-te step down\" and \"safeguard Taiwan\" from the crowd was Sunny Ma, a KMT member and retired public-school teacher, who said the incumbent government is \"moving closer and closer to dictatorship,\" leading the country to \"drift farther away from democracy and freedom.\"\nThe 60-year-old also described the recall campaigns targeting KMT lawmakers as an \"unreasonable action,\" explaining that it was like \"fighting magic with magic\" for opposition party supporters to also carry out recall campaigns targeting DPP lawmakers.\nEchoing Ma, Ryan Kuo, a 35-year-old TPP supporter, said that if the recall campaigns targeting KMT lawmakers are judged solely based on political affiliation, \"it would mean that people are not looking at what lawmakers have actually done,\" but are simply recalling them based on the party they belong to.\nIn response to the rally before it began, Lai delivered remarks to reporters ahead of a meeting with business representatives in Keelung.\nThe rally served as a testament to Taiwan being a democratic country with freedoms of assembly, association, and speech and where there is neither martial law nor a dictatorship, Lai said.\nIf the opposition parties truly want to \"resist dictatorship,\" Lai said, in reference to the rally's slogan, \"they should go to the right places and target the right people.\"\nThey should go to Tiananmen in Beijing, Lai continued.\n\"At the very least, when meeting China's authoritarian regime (in Beijing), they should stop bowing down and instead dare to … convey the hopes of the Taiwanese people for a life of democracy, freedom, and human rights and demand the regime renounce the use of force against Taiwan, in pursuit of cross-strait peace. This is what resisting dictatorship truly means.\"\nThe president said that China seeks to annex Taiwan, and all political parties, both the ruling and opposition camps, are targets of Chinese infiltration.\nThere is not just \"Green Communism,\" but also the \"Blue Communism\" and \"White Communism,\" said Lai, referring to the colors that denote the DPP, KMT, and the TPP respectively.\nHe stressed that \"regardless of party affiliation or political color, all of Taiwan should unite to resist the Chinese Communist Party, safeguard Taiwan, and defend the Republic of China.\"\nIn response to the KMT's criticism of the DPP government over the prosecutors pursuing individuals involved in alleged fraudulent signature collection for recall campaigns against DPP lawmakers, Lai said that everyone, regardless of political affiliation, should support the prosecutors in holding those who break the law accountable."

    "content": "Vatican City, April 26 (CNA) Taiwan's former Vice President Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) expressed hope on Saturday that President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) would be invited to the new pope's inauguration ceremony, after attending the late Pope Francis' funeral as Lai's envoy.\nPope Francis' funeral took place on Saturday morning on the square in front of St Peter's Basilica, where an estimated 250,000 people visited over the past three days to pay their respects to the late pope, who died on April 21 at the age of 88.\nAccording to the Vatican, some 163 delegations attended the ceremony, among them 12 reigning monarchs, 42 heads of state, six deputy heads of state, six countries' speakers, and representatives from nine United Nations organizations.\nChen told CNA after attending the two-hour-long funeral that he arrived at the funeral venue slightly early, approached former U.S. President Joe Biden, and had a brief conversation with him.\nWhile Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017, he was responsible for launching the \"Cancer Moonshot Initiative\" to fight cancer, according to Chen.\nChen, who was then vice president of Taiwan's top academic research institution, Academia Sinica, told Biden that Academia Sinica had also joined the Cancer Moonshot Initiative and that both sides were continuing their cooperation on the project.\nIn response, Biden told him \"Go, go, go, keep it going,\" Chen said.\nDuring the brief talk, Chen said he also thanked Biden for his administration's efforts in sealing the \"U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade,\" with the first agreement under the initiative taking effect in late 2024.\nAside from Biden and a brief conversation with Japan's top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya, Chen told CNA that he also had the opportunity to have cordial exchanges with the delegation heads from Paraguay and Guatemala, two of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, as well as with several cardinals and clergies before and during the funeral.\nOverall, Chen said he believed he had completed his mission as Lai's special envoy to Pope Francis' funeral service.\n► Ex-Vice President Chen greets Biden, Japan's top diplomat at pope funeral\nAside from expressing hope that the late pope would continue to bless Taiwan's diplomatic relations with the Vatican, Chen said he sincerely hoped President Lai could represent Taiwan at the upcoming papal inauguration once a new pope is selected.\nTaiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has said the appointment of Chen was the result of discussions between Taipei and the Holy See, but neither MOFA nor the Presidential Office elaborated on why Lai was not attending the event in person.\nDeputy Foreign Minister François Wu (吳志中), instead, told reporters on Wednesday that Chen was \"the best choice under the current circumstances,\" citing the devout Catholic's personal ties with the late pope as the main reason.\nAccording to MOFA, Chen had previously met with Pope Francis on six occasions and was selected as an academician of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 2021.\nWu, who joined Chen during his Vatican trip, told CNA on Saturday that attending the late pope's funeral provides Taiwan with a rare international occasion.\n\"This is a global meeting and our participation has demonstrated that Taiwan is part of the world,\" Wu said.\nHe also said that Chen was seated next to Thailand's representative, as delegations at the funeral were arranged in alphabetical order according to French, the official language of diplomacy.\nThe Holy See is the only diplomatic ally of the Republic of China (ROC), the official name of Taiwan, in Europe. Formal diplomatic ties were established in 1942 when the ROC government was still based in mainland China.\nThe Vatican's relations with Beijing have warmed, however, since Francis assumed the papacy in 2013.\nIn 2018, Beijing and the Vatican struck a historic deal to work together on appointing Chinese bishops, which was extended for a third time in late 2024.\nTensions in the relationship have developed since then after Beijing contravened the agreement by unilaterally making the appointments.\nRelated NewsApril 23: President Lai pays respects at Taipei memorial for Pope FrancisApril 21: Taiwan mourns death of Pope Francis Former President Ma Ying-jeou attends the inaugural Mass of Pope Francis at the Vatican on March 19, 2013, during his second four-year term that began in 2012.

    "content": "Taipei, April 27 (CNA) China Medical University Hospital (CMUH) admitted on Saturday that a letter published in The Lancet this month by its doctors about Taiwan's healthcare system being \"on the brink of systemic collapse\" contained factual errors.\nThe Taichung-based hospital said in a statement that it identified multiple mistakes in a letter authored by two of its doctors that was published in volume 405 of the renowned medical journal.\nCMUH said that the doctors were \"deeply apologetic\" over the erroneous content and have formally requested that The Lancet publish a correction.\nAccording to CMUH, the letter written by Li Jing-xing (李景行) and Hsu Shu-bai (許漱白) inaccurately stated that Taiwan's COVID-19 hospitalization fatality rate was 58.2 percent.\nThe hospital said the figure was a misreading of a 2025 study by Chang Gung Memorial Hospital published in Infection and Drug Resistance, which found that 58.2 percent of critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring intubation were infected with the omicron variant, not that 58.2 percent of hospitalized patients had died.\nCMUH also said the letter erroneously reported that Taiwan had 62 nurses per 10,000 people in 2021, when the actual number was 78 nurses per 10,000 people.\nThe hospital also said a supporting document meant to illustrate the healthcare system's interconnectedness was mistakenly replaced with the wrong file.\nCMUH said the errors caused unnecessary confusion among Taiwan's medical community, and the authors had compiled a detailed list of mistakes for correction.\nThe hospital emphasized that the government has prioritized addressing healthcare system strain in the post-pandemic era, with the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) holding multiple meetings to coordinate response strategies.\nIt added that Taiwan's National Health Insurance system has long provided \"exceptionally high standards of treatment\" and remains a model for other countries.\nOn Saturday, Taiwan's Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-yuan (邱泰源) criticized the letter, saying that using incorrect statistics to attack Taiwan's health system was \"deeply unfair\" to medical workers."

In the video, a woman can be seen interviewing one \"protester\" and asking him, in Mandarin, why he decided to join the rally.\nThe participant did not understand the question, and after another participant translated it into Vietnamese, said, \"An older man brought me here.\"\nThe two \"protesters\" were part of a group whose members all wore blue caps sporting the name and slogan of KMT lawmaker Cheng Cheng-chien (鄭正鈐), who represents Hsinchu City.\nLin Chih-chieh (林志潔), an academic in the field of law, shared the video and a photo of a group of people wearing blue caps on Hsinchu City's Nanda Road.

The office did not conduct a background check of all participants at the time, it added.\nThe office said it later confirmed that some of the participants were foreign-born spouses of Taiwanese citizens, who also held Taiwanese citizenship.\nOthers were children of Taiwanese citizens and their foreign spouses, Cheng's office said, claiming that none were migrant workers.\nMeanwhile, the MOL said in a statement on Saturday night that it will launch an investigation with the NIA to clarify the situation and take action if any laws were broken.\nThe Employment Service Act stipulates that employers must not \"assign the employed foreign worker to work outside the scope of the work permitted,\" according to the MOL.\nEmployers found to have contravened this rule will receive a fine of NT$30,000 (US$921.64) to NT$150,000 and have their authorization to hire foreign workers revoked, the MOL said."

    "content": "Taipei, April 28 (CNA) The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) on Monday said Taiwan should seek a tariff exemption for its information and communications technology (ICT) products during negotiations with the United States.\nSpeaking at a forum on U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, CIER President Lien Hsien-ming (連賢明) urged the government to seek a tariff exemption for Taiwan's electronics supply chain, noting that about 70 percent of the country's exports to the U.S. are ICT products.\nThe impact of tariffs on Taiwan's ICT industry could be enormous, Lien said, as it would not be easy for Taiwanese suppliers to relocate production to the U.S. market anytime soon, as Trump intended.\nOn April 2, Trump announced \"reciprocal\" tariffs on countries with large trade surpluses with the U.S., including Taiwan, which faced a blanket 32 percent import duty. A 90-day pause was announced on April 9.\nOn April 11, Washington and Taipei held their first meeting, with Taiwan's Office of Trade Negotiations saying that tariffs, trade barriers and export controls were discussed.\nPresident Lai Ching-te (賴清德) described the process of the first round of talks as \"smooth.\" The Executive Yuan said it expected another round of negotiations will begin soon.\nCIER predicted Taiwan's economic growth could slow to 1.66 percent in 2025, compared to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics' (DGBAS) forecast of 3.14 percent in late February.\nTaiwan's economy grew 4.59 percent in 2024, according to a preliminary reading by the DGBAS.\nLien said it would not be wise for Taiwan to take tough action in retaliation for Trump's tariffs, given that Taiwan's economy is much smaller than that of the U.S.\nHe said he expected Trump to set a reciprocal tariff of 15-20 percent on goods made in Taiwan.\nYang Shu-fei (楊書菲), deputy head of CIER's Regional Development Study Center, said at the forum that Taiwan could help the U.S. rebuild its manufacturing sector by sharing its experience in developing science parks and industrial zones.\nYang said such parks and zones could create jobs and upgrade manufacturing in the U.S., while Washington could use its roughly 300 free trade zones to trade goods made by Taiwanese manufacturers and help reduce its trade deficit.\nAccording to CIER, the U.S.-Taiwan trade deficit rose from US$47.8 billion to US$73.9 billion in 2024, driven by a surge in U.S. imports."

They were subsequently more composed and surefooted in handling tasks such as transporting and sheltering the injured in a later drill.\nThe second day began with drills to transport injured soldiers from a battlefield to a medical station behind the frontlines.\nIn another scenario, the participants searched for and rescued semi-conscious or injured people trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building after a missile strike, and took the injured to shelters or emergency medical stations. The participants also tested their ability to manage a busy medical station swamped with injured people.\nDeputy Interior Minister Maa Shyh-yuan (馬士元), NFA head Hsiao Huan-chang (蕭煥章), members of the Presidential Office's Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, and several retired generals from Taiwan's military observed the drills.\nIn Maa's remarks at the event, he said the participants were all members of private-sector civil defense groups, which was an indication of the people's determination to resist external threats against Taiwan's military, freedom and democracy.\nHe expressed the hope of seeing increased public participation in such activities, which he said would help build greater resilience in society.\nFRA Chairman Jason Chen (陳彥升), also spoke at the event, saying that the threats posed by China were growing.\nCivilians should serve as a backup for the armed forces in the event of a war and during natural disasters, so that the country can better channel its strengths, Chen said.\nThe FRA, an NGO that promotes political conservatism and upholding national security, organized the event in the hope of preparing civil society for times when its strength might be needed, Chen said, adding that the FRA is planning to hold more drills across Taiwan.\nOn Sunday, Lucy Liu (劉玉皙), a member of the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, gave a briefing to staff members from the Japanese, Canadian, and Dutch representative offices in Taiwan, who were observing the drills.\nLiu said there were around 20 civil defense groups around Taiwan -- not including the Kuma Academy and the Forward Alliance -- that offer training in fitness, combat, shelter management, first aid, and drone operation.\nChen Jung-pin (陳榮彬), a member of a New Taipei-based civil defense group, told CNA that he found the after-action review to be particularly useful, as it gave the participants an opportunity to figure out ways of improving their approach.\nHe also said that a joint exercise involving different groups allowed them to network and learn about each other's resources, so they could collaborate instead of \"going it alone.\"\nYu Tsung-chi (余宗基), a retired Army major general and special consultant for FRA, said that Taiwan's Armed Forces are training to rapidly take defensive positions in the event that the Chinese People's Liberation Army switches from an exercise to a surprise attack.\nIn such a scenario, the joint civil defense drills would also shorten civilian response time and streamline the necessary actions, Yu said."

(TSMC) will form a joint venture with Intel and others to run the American chipmaker's wafer foundry operations, but TSMC Chairman C.C. Wei (魏哲家) denied the rumors at an investor conference on April 17.\nInternational news media have reported that TSMC, under pressure from the Trump administration's tariffs, will take a stake in the new company to rescue Intel's wafer foundry operations. That has raised concerns over possible leaks of business secrets from TSMC."

    "content": "Taipei, April 28 (CNA) Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) met with ruling and opposition party lawmakers on Monday to rally support for a government-proposed bill partly aimed at mitigating any negative effects of impending American tariffs.\nCho said the NT$410 billion (US$12.6 billion) special bill is intended not only to respond to tariff adjustments announced by the Trump administration but to bolster Taiwan's economic, social and homeland security resilience \"in response to international developments.\"\nThe premier said the funding would come from budget surpluses of previous years and \"won't increase the government's debt\" through new borrowing.\nAccording to Cho, the bill allocates NT$93 billion for industry and employment support, NT$150 billion for strengthening homeland security resilience, and NT$167 billion for social welfare measures, including subsidies for electricity costs and insurance fund injections.\nThe funds supporting industry include NT$12 billion in interest subsidies for trade financing, NT$5 billion for expanded small business loan guarantees, and NT$25 billion for research and development grants for businesses, Cho said.\nThe homeland security budget would fund new patrol vessels to counter Chinese \"gray zone\" maritime activities, build new storage and backup facilities for critical supplies, and upgrade Taiwan's cybersecurity defenses, he said.\nSubsidies would also be provided to cover electricity costs that state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) has absorbed over the past three years, with NT$100 billion budgeted for that purpose.\nFu Kun-chi (傅崐萁), caucus whip of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), told Cho that his party supported actions to counter U.S. tariffs, but he expressed concern that only 23 percent of the funding was directly linked to trade measures.\nFu suggested that \"non-urgent parts\" of the special bill, such as the subsidies for Taipower, could be proposed separately through a standard supplementary budget or other process.\nKMT caucus secretary-general Wang Hung-wei (王鴻薇) criticized the act's expansion from NT$88 billion to NT$410 billion and questioned why industry assistance increased only from NT$88 billion to NT$93 billion despite the larger overall growth.\nThe Cabinet first pledged a NT$88 billion relief package on April 4 to help Taiwanese exporters survive the adverse impact of a 32 percent tariff on their goods, which was announced by Trump a day earlier.\nWang said it was \"worrying\" that government support for affected businesses, farmers, and workers remained insufficient given the scale of the expected economic impact.\nShe also questioned why the government was proposing to inject another NT$100 billion into Taipower after the Legislative Yuan had previously slashed similar subsidies.\nHuang Kuo-chang (黃國昌), caucus whip of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), told Cho his party \"100 percent\" supported financial assistance for businesses and workers, but he criticized the government for failing to provide a detailed impact assessment report.\nHuang suggested the government was attempting to \"smuggle\" previous spending proposals, such as the Taipower subsidy, into the new special act without sufficient justification.\nTPP deputy caucus convener Chang Chi-kai (張啓楷) said the budget violated fiscal discipline by blending unrelated projects into an urgent bill intended as a response to tariffs.\nCho said the government's goal is to negotiate tariffs with the United States at rates \"no higher than those [imposed by the U.S.] on competitor countries,\" while maintaining Taiwan's industrial competitiveness and safeguarding consumer habits."

It had a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points."

    "content": "Taipei, April 29 (CNA) Partly cloudy to sunny skies are expected to prevail across Taiwan on Tuesday and Wednesday, with scattered showers likely in some parts of the island, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) has forecast.\nOn Tuesday, sporadic showers are expected in eastern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula in the south, while isolated afternoon showers can be expected in mountainous areas in western Taiwan, the CWA said.\nThe weather around Taiwan will be relatively cool Tuesday due to the effect of seasonal northeasterly winds. Daytime highs will range from 26 to 28 degrees Celsius in northern and eastern Taiwan and reach 29-31 degrees around the rest of the island, the CWA forecast.\nLows are expected to hover around 18-20 degrees in northern Taiwan and 21-23 degrees elsewhere, the CWA said.\nIn Taiwan's outlying counties, temperatures are forecast to hover around 23-27 degrees in Penghu County, 20-28 degrees in Kinmen County, and 16-21 degrees in Lienchiang County (Matsu Islands), according to the CWA forecast.\nAs the northeasterly winds strengthen Tuesday, the western Taiwan coast from Taoyuan to Yunlin, Orchid and Green islands and the Hengchun Peninsula in the south, and Penghu could see sustained winds of 39-50 kilometers per hour, with gusts of 62-75 kph, the CWA said.\nTemperatures will rise on Wednesday as the northeasterly winds weaken, with mostly sunny skies expected across Taiwan, but there still could be sporadic rainfall in the east, according to the CWA.\nAnother front is expected to pass near northern Taiwan on Thursday, bringing showers to parts of northern Taiwan, and mountainous areas in the center and south, said Wu Der-rong (吳德榮), an adjunct associate professor at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University.\nFrom Friday to Tuesday next week, mostly sunny to partly cloudy skies and warm temperatures are forecast for most of Taiwan, which may be accompanied by afternoon showers and thunderstorms, Wu said, citing the latest European weather simulation model."

    "date": "2025-04-29",
    "content": "By Chao Yen-hsiang, CNA staff writer\nWhen Taiyuan Textile has played a game in Taiwan's Women's Super Basketball League (WSBL) this season, one player has stood out: Marie Gülich.\nStanding 1.95 meters tall, she easily towers over everyone in the WSBL except for 1.93 m Australian Cayla George of the Cathay Life Tigers, the team the Textile will look to dethrone in the WSBL best-of-five championship series that opens on May 3.\nShe has also performed up to her WNBA pedigree. In 23 regular-season games, the 30-year-old Gülich was only one of two players to put up a double-double average, leading the WSBL with 13.9 points per game and finishing second with 10.1 rebounds per game.\nWhat has surprised people is not her dominance on the court in Taiwan but simply her presence in a place where she had never set foot before that is not known as a basketball power.\nThat is especially true given that Gülich captained Germany's then-world No. 19 national team to a seventh-place finish in its Olympic debut in Paris in August 2024, suggesting even bigger things on the horizon.\n\"When my agent called me, saying there was a team in Taipei City interested in me ... I'm not gonna lie, I had to look up where Taiwan was,\" Gülich told CNA in a recent interview in New Taipei, 9,422 kilometers away from her hometown of Cologne.\nWith her first season in Taipei now drawing to a close, Gülich said she has no regrets about choosing to play in Taiwan and \"wouldn't do it any other way\" when it came to her first experience in Asia.\nBasketball: A life changerGülich had tried football and handball as a child, but she only found her \"comfort zone\" in basketball when she was first introduced to the sport at age 12.As a girl who had long felt uneasy about her height, basketball was the first place where she could fully embrace her body.\"Growing up, I was always taller than everyone, and I was very uncomfortable in my body. People would always comment on how tall I was, and I felt a little ashamed,\" she recalled.\"I think once I set foot in that gym, I felt comfortable because my height was something special and positive. I think that's why I stuck with basketball in the first place.\"Marie Gülich (in blue) secures a rebound during the Taiyuan Textile's practice on Friday. CNA photo April 29, 2025Gülich, who did not initially plan to go pro, became the fourth German player ever drafted into the WNBA in 2018, when she was selected 12th overall in the first round by the Phoenix Mercury, after four years at Oregon State in the NCAA.She played for three WNBA teams over three seasons while also competing in Italy and Poland during the WNBA offseason. In 2020, she left the WNBA and joined Valencia Basket in Spain, winning multiple championships in Europe before signing with Taiyuan.Taiwan is the fifth country in which she has played for an overseas club.\"I love [basketball], but I love what comes with it [even more],\" she said. \"I love that you meet really cool people, that I can grow as a person, challenge myself, and see the world.\"Gülich: The game changerGermany's ranking in women's basketball has steadily climbed since Gülich joined the national team in 2018, rising from No. 58 to No. 13 as of FIBA's latest update on Feb. 9.Commentator Ku Yen-wei (古硯偉) described Gülich as the \"centerpiece that binds the team together,\" her career epitomizing the rise of Germany's middle-generation female players.\"Marie is special because teamwork is her priority, and we really appreciate that. That's why we reached out to her without hesitation,\" Taiyuan head coach Chiu Chi-yi (邱啟益) told CNA.Marie Gülich (center). CNA photo April 29, 2025Taiyuan approached Gülich in September 2024, while she was recovering from a knee injury. The WSBL season, which began in January, turned out to be a perfect fit for her recovery timeline, and she officially signed in October.Asked about basketball in Taiwan, Gülich pointed to a play style that was faster and freer compared to the structured, strategy-driven play typical in Europe, and said Taiwanese players deserved respect for their game and effort.\"I see my teammates and everyone practice so hard every day. Over the past years, this program has been working, building, and striving to win a championship,\" said Gülich, now locked in on helping Taiyuan snap its decade-long title drought.Marie Gülich. Photo courtesy of Marie GülichTaiyuan advanced to the WSBL finals with a league-best 21-3 regular-season record. They will face a steep challenge against the Tigers, who have won every championship in the WSBL's 20 seasons except for one, in 2010 when the team did not compete in the league.\"This is like an adventure for me, but I take it very seriously,\" Gülich said.Both her coach and teammates praised her work ethic, noting her meticulous approach to diet, sleep, and training.\"Our practices usually start at 12:30 p.m., but she often arrives at 11:30 a.m. to do warm-ups and weightlifting. That has motivated our local players to prepare earlier, too,\" Chiu said, adding that Gülich has often brought new ideas and actively engaged in discussions during game tape reviews.Lin Wen-yu (林文佑), one of Gülich's teammates, said it was a huge honor to play alongside someone of her stature. \"It feels like when Dwight Howard came to play in Taiwan a few years ago,\" she said.Till next timeLife in Taiwan is completely different from Gülich's past experiences in the United States and Europe, where players usually live separately in their own apartments.\"Here, it feels like being back in college -- living together, eating together. It feels more like a community, and I really enjoy that,\" she said.Photo courtesy of Marie GülichAside from the WSBL's hectic schedule -- three games in three consecutive days each week -- the league's four-team structure and smaller, scattered crowds have also been a new experience for her.\"Obviously, I prefer having a big crowd and lots of energy because you feed off that ... so I'm really looking forward to the finals.\"Gülich will return to Germany after the championship series to prepare for the Women's EuroBasket tournament in June.Yet she said she will cherish the friendships she has built and looks forward to revisiting Taiwan, where she had a \"smooth transition\" thanks to the English signage and efficient MRT system.\"The adjustment is still there -- there's a different culture and a lot of Chinese around -- but you can still navigate the city. It's so well organized, like the MRT system. It's so easy to get around and it's a smooth transition.\"So if someone asked me, 'I haven't traveled to Asia, where should I go?' I would say, 'Go to Taiwan for sure.'\"Enditem/lsPhoto courtesy of Marie Gülich"

    "content": "Taipei, April 29 (CNA) Inventec Corp., one of the leading contract electronics makers in Taiwan, has decided to build a facility in the U.S. state of Texas to roll out artificial intelligence services and related items amid tariff threats posted by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nIn a statement posted to the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), where Inventec shares are traded, the company said on Monday that its board of directors has approved a plan to invest up to US$85 million in the United States.\nInventec said it will seek a venue in Texas through its U.S. subsidiary to build the production base and the investment plan will be carried out during May-December, while there is no timetable yet about when the U.S. plant will start mass production.\nThe fund used in the Texas investment plan will come from its own disposable capital and bank loans, Inventec said.\nInventec said the US$85 million will not cover the purchases of production equipment.\nThe company said the decision to build a Texas facility aims to lower the impact resulting from the Trump administration's tariff policies after the U.S. president announced on April 2 sweeping reciprocal tariffs on countries that have higher trade surpluses with Washington, including Taiwan, which faces a 32 percent duty.\nThe White House announced a 90-day pause on the new measures on April 9, with a 10 percent duty applied to all countries except China, to allow its trading partners to negotiate for a lower levy.\nInventec said the U.S. investment is part of its global expansion, while the Texas plant is expected to cater to its American clients and reinforce business ties with them.\nCurrently, Inventec runs facilities in Mexico to produce a wide range of electronics products such as servers, notebook computers and automotive electronics. According to Inventec, the company has studied the possibility of investing in the U.S. since January as it is not easy to ship expensive servers in terms of their large size to the U.S. market from overseas.\nIn its annual report, Inventec said it will keep a close eye on the impact on the global supply chain resulting from the U.S. tariff policies and adjust production in its global network in a prompt manner in a bid to maintain its profitability.\nInventec said its server sales will continue to grow in 2025 on the back of a rising popularity of generative AI development, high-performance computing devices, cloud services and 5G smart applications.\nIn 2024, the company posted about NT$7.2 billion (US$223 million) in net profit, up 18.54 percent from a year earlier with earnings per share at NT$2.03, compared with NT$1.71 in 2023.\nAmong the major Taiwanese firms, iPhone assembler and AI server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. has also set up a foothold in Texas, as the company has started investments in the U.S. market since 1985.\nIn addition, Quanta Computer Inc., another AI server supplier, is likely to expand production in its two plants located in California and Tennessee to meet demand from clients, while rival Wistron Corp. announced in December to optimize its facility in Texas.\nFor its part, Compal Electronics, Inc., another AI server producer, said in January that Texas is one of its top options as it mulls investing in the U.S."

    "content": "Taipei, April 29 (CNA) Several road safety groups criticized the Highway Bureau on Tuesday for its plan to introduce a mandatory \"pointing and calling\" requirement in driving tests, saying the \"stupid\" regulation lacked consensus from civil groups and could compromise traffic safety.\nAfter a meeting with road safety groups last Friday, Highway Bureau officials told the press that the driving test for sedans -- or small passenger cars -- would include a new \"pointing and calling\" requirement starting June 2, Luna Chen (陳愷寧), chairperson of the Taiwan Vision Zero Alliance, said at a news conference in Taipei.\nLearner drivers who fail to perform the newly required action during the test will not pass, she added.\n\"Everyone agrees this is a stupid regulation, yet the government rushed to make the decision and even issued a press release using civil groups as endorsement tools,\" Chen said.\nShe criticized the Highway Bureau -- the government agency responsible for overseeing driving tests and issuing driver's licenses -- for showing \"a complete lack of respect\" toward civil groups.\n\"Pointing and calling\" is a safety confirmation method that originated in Japan, involving gesture and verbal confirmation to prevent operational errors, according to a social media post by Transportation Minister Chen Shih-kai (陳世凱) last October.\nOn Taiwan's roads, currently only drivers of certain bus lines are required to perform such checks -- stopping their vehicles, pointing to the left, front, and right, and verbally confirming that no pedestrians are present -- before turning at intersections, said Teddy Lin (林柏勛), a member of the alliance.\nLin said that even drivers of large trucks have only been asked to follow a non-mandatory government campaign to stop before turning since last August, with no requirement for \"pointing and calling\" checks.\n\"In Europe and the United States, where driving behavior is more strictly regulated, drivers are only required to perform a head turn to check, commonly known as a 'shoulder check,'\" he added.\nHis alliance opposes the new requirement for sedans, Lin said, arguing that it would not only be difficult to enforce but also disrupt smooth traffic flow, thereby compromising safety.\nEchoing Lin, Roy Lo (羅宜), a member of the Taiwan Motorcycle Rights Promotion Association, said that requiring more vehicles to perform \"pointing and calling\" would significantly slow down traffic.\nLo questioned, \"How many cars would even be able to pass through a single traffic light cycle under such conditions?\"\nLin suggested that all drivers should be required to perform \"shoulder checks\" at intersections and crosswalks and check their blind spots -- steps that are not clearly mandated under the current regulations.\nIn response, the Highway Bureau issued a statement on Monday that the new \"pointing and calling\" requirement for the sedan driving test was only under \"internal discussion,\" and that June 2 was merely a \"proposed\" implementation date, not an officially finalized one.\nTaking into account \"differing public opinions,\" the bureau said it would continue to consult with relevant stakeholders and review the policy as needed to ensure it \"better meets practical needs.\"\nThe bureau did not ask civil groups to endorse the new requirement, it added."

Turnover totaled NT$238.64 billion (US$7.39 billion).\nAfter the main board closed above the 20,00 point mark Monday for the first time since April 2, when the Trump administration announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, the market opened slightly lower Tuesday but soon regained its footing as bargain hunters turned active to take advantage of recent heavy losses caused by tariff fears, dealers said.\n\"Today's buying focused on non-tech stocks, while the electronics sector saw its gains capped after reports said China's Huawei Technologies is ready to test its newest artificial intelligence chip to rival Nvidia Corp.'s,\" Concord Securities analyst Kerry Huang said.\nThe electronics index rose 0.99 percent with the semiconductor sub-index up 0.64 percent after contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the most heavily weighted stock here, gained 0.56 percent to close at NT$902.00.\nTSMC's American depositary receipts lost 1.03 percent and Nvidia shares shed 2.05 percent overnight after a Wall Street Journal report said Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing its new AI chip Ascend 910D, which could match Nvidia's H100 chip.\n\"It was no surprise that TSMC stayed in consolidation mode and so did the entire tech sector,\" Huang said.\nAmong other semiconductor stocks in the local market, smartphone IC designer MediaTek Inc. rose 1.09 percent to close at NT$1,370.00, while application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designer AIchip Technologies Inc. fell 0.68 percent to end at NT$2175.00.\nSelect AI-related stocks were also affected by the Huawei report with iPhone assembler and AI server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second to TSMC in terms of market value, rose only 0.35 percent to close at NT$143.00 and Quanta Computer Inc., another AI server supplier, lost 1.02 percent to end at NT$242.50.\n\"Buying rotated to old economy and financial stocks, but I prefer to say the gains were technical in nature after recent heavy losses,\" Huang said.\nIn the electric machinery industry, which rose 3.73 percent, Fortune Electric Co. gained 4.81 percent to close at NT$425.00, and Shihlin Electric & Engineering Corp. added 2.85 percent to end at NT$144.50.\nThe petrochemical sector rose 1.94 percent, with Formosa Plastics Corp. up 2.07 percent to close at NT$34.55 and Nan Ya Plastics Corp. up 1.64 percent to end at NT$30.95.

    "content": "Taipei, April 29 (CNA) Several batches of oysters and avocados imported from the United States have been intercepted by customs officials after being found to contain excessive levels of the heavy metal cadmium, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) said Tuesday.\nAccording to the TFDA's weekly briefing, three of the eight shipments that failed inspection this week originated in the U.S., including 405 kilograms of Pacific oysters and a total of 3,796.8 kilograms of avocados imported by two separate companies.\nTFDA Deputy Director-General Lin Chin-fu (林金富) said the oysters, imported by Jing Yuan International Trading Co., were found to contain 2 parts per million (ppm) of cadmium, exceeding the regulatory limit of 1 ppm for oysters.\nAs a result of the violation, the TFDA will tighten inspections for Jing Yuan, increasing the sampling rate from the standard 2-10 percent to a stricter 20-50 percent, Lin said.\nIn addition, Chiawei Enterprise Co. and Ourmart Marketing Co. each imported 2,531.2 kilograms and 1,265.6 kilograms of substandard avocados, respectively. These shipments were found to contain cadmium levels ranging from 0.08 to 0.12 ppm, surpassing Taiwan's permissible limit of 0.05 ppm.\nIn response, the TFDA also raised the inspection rate for the avocado importers to between 20-50 percent, Lin said.\nAll non-compliant products were either returned to their country of origin or destroyed at the border and did not enter the local market, according to the TFDA."

    "content": "Taipei, April 29 (CNA) Investigations into cases of alleged signature forgeries in recall vote campaigns continued on Tuesday, with prosecutors detaining a KMT city branch secretary in New Taipei, releasing three KMT local officials, and requesting the detention of three others in Keelung.\nKMT New Taipei City Branch Secretary-General Chen Chen-jung (陳貞容) was ordered detained and held incommunicado by the New Taipei District Court after being questioned for over two hours, according to the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office.\nThe office said Chen is suspected of being involved in forging signatures in a campaign to recall Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers. The suspicion follows lawsuits filed by DPP legislators Su Chiao-hui (蘇巧慧) and Lee Kuen-cheng (李坤城) who alleged that false signatures were used in the recall efforts targeting them.\nChen was among four KMT local officials brought in during a second wave of searches on Monday. The other three -- Tsai Kan-tzu (蔡甘子), Chu Pei-yi (朱蓓儀), and Lo Ta-yu (羅大宇) -- were released after questioning, prosecutors said.\nThe searches on Monday included the KMT's New Taipei City branch and followed earlier raids on April 15 targeting 30 locations, including the KMT's Banqiao District and Sanchong District branches.\nOn Tuesday, the KMT's New Taipei City branch chairman Huang Chih-hsiung (黃志雄) criticized Chen's detention as politically motivated and said the party would \"definitely\" file an appeal.\nHuang said it was \"incomprehensible\" that prosecutors would initiate a second round of searches and questioning without presenting new evidence.\nHe also argued that the court's approval of the detention order after a \"short one hour\" hearing raised further concerns about the fairness of the proceedings.\nIn a separate case, prosecutors said they raided six locations in Taiwan's northern city of Keelung on Monday, including the KMT city branch and residences of recall organizers targeting DPP city councilors Cheng Wen-ting (鄭文婷) and Jiho Tiun (張之豪).\nThe Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau's (MJIB) Keelung City Field Office executed the searches and brought in Chi Wen-chuan (紀文荃), the chief petitioner in the recall campaign against Cheng; Yu Cheng-yi (游正義), the chief petitioner in the recall campaign against Tiun; and Hsu Shao-yeh (許紹業), the designated replacement leader in the Cheng recall, for questioning on suspicion of involvement in forging documents, prosecutors said.\nAuthorities also questioned the KMT's Ren'ai District branch director Chang Chin-fa (張金發), branch chairman Wu Kuo-sheng (吳國勝), first section chief Hsiao Chuang-feng (蕭壯峰), and branch secretary-general Li Ming-yi (李銘議) as witnesses.\nAfter questioning, Chang Chin-fa and Wu were reclassified as suspects and transferred for further interrogation, the MJIB's Keelung City Field Office said.\nProsecutors suspect that Keelung City Government's Department of Civil Affairs Director Chang Yuan-hsiang (張淵翔) accessed the household registration system to assist in verifying or obtaining personal data for the recall petition, in violation of civil service neutrality.\nProsecutors said they submitted requests to Keelung District Court to formally detain Chang Yuan-hsiang, Chi and Chang Chin-fa on Tuesday. The court had not yet made a decision, as of press time.\nWu was released on NT$300,000 (US$9,295) bail, Yu on NT$150,000, and Hsu on NT$30,000, prosecutors said.\nIn both New Taipei and Keelung, the campaigners were attempting to gather signatures required to trigger a public recall vote under the Public Officials Election and Recall Act."

Resolution 2758 by creating the illusion that Taiwan belonged to the PRC, its statement said.\nResolution 2758 was adopted by the 26th U.N. General Assembly in 1971 to address the issue of China's representation at the international body.\nIt resulted in the ROC losing its seat at the U.N. to the PRC. Taiwan has since been excluded from participating in the international organization and its affiliates, as it is not recognized by the U.N. and a majority of its member states as a country.\nMOFA did not say in its statement if it believed the latest decision had something to do with Taiwan's warming relations with Somaliland.\nSomaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 and has functioned as a sovereign state ever since, but is not officially recognized by any other country.\nTies between Taiwan and Somaliland have warmed since the two sides set up representative offices in each other's capitals in 2020.\nIt was unclear if Somalia's move would have any effect on Taiwanese diplomats stationed in Somaliland.\nMeanwhile, in its statement Tuesday, which MOFA said was issued a full week after Somalia's announcement because getting clarification took time due to the lack of bilateral communications, MOFA called on Taiwanese to avoid traveling to Somalia and Somaliland for the time being.\nIt said any travel to the region should wait until Taiwan and Somaliland jointly resolved the issue, given the fact that Somalia controls the airspace over Somaliland.\nTaiwan and Somaliland are asking Somalia to immediate revoke the decision on not accepting Taiwan passport and will ask international organizations and like-minded countries to push for the revocation, it said.\nThe Somali announcement is not expected to have much of an impact on outbound travel from Taiwan. Taiwan government data shows that Taiwanese only made 16 visits to Somalia from 2016 to February 2025."

The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent, the foundation said.\nThe results suggest \"strong consensus\" among the American public on Taiwan's sovereignty and strategic importance to the United States across party lines, age groups and other demographics, the press release said.\nAccording to Dane Waters, president of the Humanity for Freedom Foundation, the poll results \"send a clear message.\"\n\"The American people stand firmly with Taiwan. It is time for the U.S. government to reflect this sentiment by strengthening our diplomatic and strategic relationship with Taiwan,\" Waters said.\nDescribing Taiwan as \"a democratic ally and a critical partner,\" he also called for Washington to \"abandon the policy of strategic ambiguity and formally recognize Taiwan.\"\nThe U.S.-based Humanity for Freedom Foundation describes itself as a nonprofit organization committed to advancing freedom and democracy globally."

By midnight on Tuesday, three others had been released on varying bail amounts, while four people were sent home.\nThe raids mirrored other actions by prosecutors around Taiwan in recent weeks, mostly targeted at opposition KMT offices to crack down on alleged signature fraud in campaigns to recall DPP lawmakers or local government officials.\nAs of Wednesday, prosecutors had raided KMT chapters in several areas, including Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung City, Yilan County and Kaohsiung.\nThe investigations have resulted in the detention of several KMT chapter officials, including KMT Taipei chapter Chair Huang Lu Chin‑ju (黃呂錦茹)."

    "content": "Taipei, April 30 (CNA) An index gauging Taiwan's manufacturing sector weakened significantly in March, hurt by the economic uncertainty created by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) said Wednesday.\nThe TIER's economic composite index, which gauges the manufacturing sector's health, fell sharply by 4.54 points from a month earlier to 12.12 in March, to flash a \"yellow-blue\" light, indicating sluggish growth.\nThat compared with a \"yellow-red\" light seen in February and a yellow-blue light in January, the TIER said.\nTIER uses a five-color system to assess economic activity in the sector, with \"red\" indicating overheating, \"yellow-red\" showing fast growth, \"green\" representing stable growth, \"yellow-blue\" signaling sluggish growth, and \"blue\" meaning contraction.\nThe think tank said Trump's unpredictability in repeatedly adjusting his tariff policies had driven up risks to global trade.\nHe first announced sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on April 2 on countries that have higher trade surpluses with Washington, including a 32 percent import duty on goods from Taiwan, before announcing a 90-day pause a week later.\nGrowth and activity has shown signs of moderating in the local information and communications and electronics component sectors, which continue to enjoy strong global demand for emerging technologies, boosting industrial production, the TIER said.\nTrump's tariff policies have also sent ripples through stock markets, hurting sentiment among manufacturers, the TIER said.\nAmong the five factors comprising the March composite index, the sub-indexes on demand, the general business climate, purchases of raw materials, and pricing moved lower by 2.40, 1.15, 0.87 and 0.15, respectively, from a month earlier, the TIER said.\nOnly the sub-index on costs bucked the downtrend, up 0.02 from a month earlier in March, the TIER said.\nBy sector, the TIER said, the electronics component and computer/ optoelectronics sectors flashed a green light in March, retreating from a red light in February as growth slowed down amid tariff uncertainties.\nThe base metal industry felt the pinch of a weak global steel market and a decline in orders from Europe and China to flash a blue light in March, compared with a yellow-blue light in February, the TIER said.\nThough semiconductor suppliers increased their demand for equipment in March, the machinery industry showed signs of slowing down, flashing a green light in March after shining a red light in February as China pushed for domestic products to replace imported items, the TIER said.\nLooking ahead, the TIER said, risks in global trade are expected to increase amid Trump's tariff policies, and the uncertainties that exist will affect business confidence worldwide and influence expansion strategies in global supply chains.\nThose trends, in turn, could negatively affect the strength of the local manufacturing sector, the TIER said.\nAlso, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on semiconductors. Those potential tariffs combined with U.S. sanctions on chip exports to China could force Taiwan's high-tech sectors to face new challenges, the TIER cautioned."

    "content": "Taipei, April 30 (CNA) A Canadian public policy institute has urged the Canadian government to drop its long-standing diplomatic ambiguity over Taiwan's status and take a clear stance in support of Taiwan's sovereignty and democracy.\nThe Macdonald-Laurier Institute (MLI), an Ottawa-based domestic and foreign policy think tank, made the recommendation in a report by Scott E. Simon released Tuesday, the day after Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party won the federal election but fell short of securing a parliamentary majority.\n\"Canada needs clarity about the international status of Taiwan in order to recalibrate policies in changing circumstances,\" the report's executive summary said, noting that the PRC's intention to \"annex Taiwan, which it has never controlled\" represents a \"substantial risk\" to Canada.\nThe MLI said Canada's approach to China's claim over Taiwan has relied on what it called \"diplomatic expediency,\" adding that since establishing ties with the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1970, Canada has only agreed to \"take note\" of Beijing's position on Taiwan, while neither endorsing nor challenging it.\nThe report noted that Canadian courts have treated Taiwan as a de facto state in legal rulings despite the lack of formal diplomatic recognition, and \"Canadian policy is already based on the knowledge that Taiwan is completely autonomous from PRC rule.\"\nThe MLI emphasized that Taiwan \"meets all the criteria for statehood\" under the Montevideo Convention, a 1933 international treaty that defines a state as having a permanent population, defined territory, government, and capacity to enter into relations with other states.\nThe report warned that the PRC is \"trying to convince the world that Taiwan has always been an integral part of China\" by claiming that United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 gave it sovereignty over Taiwan -- an assertion the MLI calls \"blatant misinformation.\"\n\"The resolution does not even mention Taiwan,\" the report said.\nThe MLI said China's legal strategy -- described as \"international lawfare\" -- is designed to prevent the UN from supporting Taiwan in the event of conflict, as it did with Ukraine following the 2022 Russian invasion.\nThe report called on Ottawa to publicly distinguish between Canada's \"One-China Policy\" and the \"One-China Principle\" that the PRC \"wants to impose on the world.\"\n\"Canada has the right to define that policy and determine our own relationship with Taiwan without external interference,\" it said.\nThe MLI urged Canada to conduct regular naval transits of the Taiwan Strait, which it said constitute international waters under international law, and to assert the importance of peace and freedom of navigation in the region as a global public good.\nThe report also recommended increased cooperation with Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines on defense, law enforcement and intelligence sharing to \"collectively deter Chinese aggressive actions.\"\nTo strengthen Taiwan's economic resilience, the MLI advised expanding bilateral trade and investment in critical areas such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and strategic mineral and energy supply chains.\nThe report concluded that such efforts would help \"lay the groundwork for the people of Taiwan to eventually fully exercise their right to self determination as promised in international law.\""

    "content": "Taipei, April 30 (CNA) More than 36,000 green iguanas have been culled since a campaign to eliminate the invasive species was launched at the beginning of this year, around three times the number in the same period of 2024, the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency (FANCA) reported Wednesday.\nTo battle the threat of the species to ecosystems and agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) in collaboration with local governments launched the campaign, the agency said in a statement.\nThe current period is a crucial time to control the green iguana population because they tend to breed in the dry season (from April to September) with priority given to removing mature female iguanas, destroying their nests and eggs, the agency said.\nThe agency has set up four teams of indigenous hunters to work together with nine professional teams commissioned by local governments to eliminate the species in the wild, it added.\nAccording to FANCA statistics, a total of 36,543 green iguanas have been culled this year, triple the number in the same period last year.\nIn addition, local governments have held 15 training sessions and trained 1,635 individuals to remove or control the reptiles, the agency said.\nThe agency implemented a ban on the importation of green iguanas in June 2015 and classified the popular pet lizard as an invasive species in September 2020, requiring owners to register their pets and banning unauthorized breeding.\nHowever, the green iguana population in Taiwan has continued to grow over the past few years, particularly in the south.\nGreen iguanas were introduced as pets to Taiwan about 20 to 30 years ago and the population has exploded since then. Around 200,000 of the reptiles are believed to be in southern and central Taiwan, according to the agency.\nTaiwan began culling iguanas nearly 10 years ago and this year, the government aims to cull 120,000 of the reptiles, the agency said.\nTo that end, the MOA set up a green iguana control task force on Dec. 5, 2024.\nIt also rolled out an agricultural damage reporting app update, which includes a green iguana reporting and removal section where professionals can post information and photos of captured iguanas.\nAs an incentive, the ministry offers professional cullers a bounty of NT$500 (US$15.64) for every captured iguana more than 30 centimeters in length, and NT$200 for every one less than 30 cm. For the general public, the bounties for captured iguanas are half that amount -- NT$250 and NT$100."

It also ordered him to undertake 150 hours of community service, with probationary supervision for the five year period.\nThe former diplomat subsequently appealed the ruling, but his appeal was rejected on Thursday by the high court, which deemed it without merit, stating that as an envoy stationed abroad, he betrayed the trust bestowed on him by the government and exploited his position for personal gain.\nHowever, the ruling can still be appealed."

(TSMC) after a chip it made ended up in an artificial intelligence processor produced by Chinese company Huawei Technologies Co., according to a Reuters report on April 8.\nThe report said TSMC could face a penalty of US$1 billion or more to settle the case.\nThe delegation also met with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier in the day.\n\"As Beijing's threats grow louder, our support for Taiwan's security, economy and democracy is unwavering,\" Pelosi said in a post on social media after the meeting.\nTheir visit to D.C. coincided with the stepping down of China hawk Mike Waltz as national security advisor. Waltz was later nominated as the ambassador to the United Nations by Trump.\nThe delegation's leader, Deputy Legislative Speaker Johnny Chiang (江啟臣) of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said Taiwan-U.S. ties would remain stable despite the changes, noting that the U.S. Congress maintained a unanimous stance on Taiwan.\nWhile the Biden and Trump administrations may differ in their approaches, their overall position toward Taiwan remained consistent, he said.\nHe pointed out that Waltz will still be able to deal with issues involving Taiwan if he does take on the role as the U.N. ambassador.\nThe delegation also includes lawmakers Chang Chih-lun (張智倫) and Huang Chien-hao (黃健豪) of the KMT, Lin Yi-chun (林憶君) of the smaller opposition Taiwan People's Party, and Wang, Chiu Yi-ying (邱議瑩) and Ngalim Tiunn (張雅琳) of the DPP.\nThey have visited the Department of Commerce, the intelligence, foreign affairs and armed services committees of the Congress, the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, the think tank Heritage Foundation and former AIT Chair Laura Rosenberger."

The designation was based on criteria established under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, which evaluates the foreign exchange practices of major U.S. trading partners.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department uses three criteria to assess potential currency manipulation: a bilateral trade surplus of at least US$15 billion with the United States; a material current account surplus of at least 3 percent of GDP; and evidence of persistent, one-sided foreign exchange intervention.\nTaiwan currently meets the first two criteria, making it likely to remain on the watch list, according to the central bank."

I can't help but look forward to seeing his progress,\" Fighters manager Tsuyoshi Shinjo was quoted as saying by Nikkan Sports.\n\"After his left foot lands, there's a slight delay before he releases the ball, so it jams the hitters. That small delay is an incredible weapon. It's not something you can develop through practice -- it's a natural-born talent.\"\nGu Lin's ERA dropped to 4.97 after the game.\nAcross his first two starts, he has issued four walks and allowed 14 hits to 57 batters, including one home run.\nThe Fighters sit second in the six-team Pacific League with a 15-12 record, one game behind the 15-10 Orix Buffaloes and half a game ahead of the Saitama Seibu Lions, now 14-12.\nThe team will next host the Lions for two games on Saturday and Sunday."

In comparison, the South Korean won rose 0.81 percent, the Singapore dollar gained 0.19 percent, the Japanese yen fell 1.61 percent against the greenback, and the Chinese yuan was little changed.\nDealers said that with the U.S. dollar dipping to the day's low of NT$30.770, down more than NT$1.20 during the session, the central bank stepped in to cap the losses suffered by the greenback and ease market volatility, but the bank's buying of the U.S. dollar was limited.\nThe central bank released a statement Friday evening, admitting its intervention in the local foreign exchange market in the day.\nIn addition to the fund inflows, the U.S. dollar also came under pressure as the local stock market steamed ahead led by the bellwether electronics sector, with the benchmark weighted index on the Taiwan Stock market soaring 552.61 points, or 2.73 percent, to close at the day's high of 20,787.64, dealers said.\nForeign institutional investors bought a net NT$38.77 billion worth of shares on the local main board Friday, increasing the downward pressure on the U.S. dollar throughout the session, dealers added.\nFor the week, the U.S. unit shed NT$1.462, or 4.71 percent, against the Taiwan dollar, marking the fifth consecutive week the currency has fallen on the Taipei foreign exchange market.\nIn another statement released Thursday, the central bank said it has not received any request from the U.S. Department of the Treasury to push for an appreciation of the Taiwan dollar, amid speculation fueled by the currency's recent sharp rise against the U.S. dollar.\nIn response to the rapid appreciation of the Taiwan dollar on Friday, Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰) said the foreign exchange rate is largely dictated by international market conditions, and that the government did not come under any pressure to push up the local currency's value.\nCho emphasized the value of the Taiwan dollar is decided by a market mechanism.\nHsu Wen-tung (許文通), chief secretary of the Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry, meanwhile, told CNA that a sharply stronger Taiwan dollar is expected to undermine the competitiveness of Taiwanese machinery exporters in the global market and lead to foreign exchange losses.\nHsu urged the government to do its best to stabilize the Taiwan dollar and called for allowing the local currency to depreciate against the U.S. dollar.\nAmid uncertainties stemming from the Trump administration's tariff policies, a stronger Taiwan dollar has added to the challenges faced by machinery suppliers, Hsu said."

On April 20, 2000, he was discovered lying in a pool of blood on the bathroom floor and died a day later.\nHis death prompted the legislation of the Gender Equity Education Act."

    "content": "Taipei, May 3 (CNA) A study conducted on Taiwan-controlled Taiping Island concluded that the South China Sea island remains an optimal habitat for land hermit crabs, according to the National Academy of Marine Research (NAMR).\nNAMR highlighted the conclusion in a Friday press release, indicating that the research was conducted on Taiping Island in 2024.\nSpecifically, NAMR researchers collected hermit crab specimens in the dry season of March and also the wet season in July.\nThrough DNA analysis of the samples collected, NAMR said Taiping Island is populated by three dominant terrestrial hermit crab species -- Coenobita rugosus, Coenobita brevimanus and Coenobita perlatus, with C. rugosus being the dominant group.\nThe NAMR research indicates that over 90 percent of hermit crabs on the island reside within natural conch shells, specifically turban snail shells, rather than land snail shells or human litter.\nThe statistic reveals that the island has an abundance of conch resources that provide a fruitful natural habitat for hermit crabs.\nThe NAMR explained that a 2024 report by academics from other countries found that of the 17 known terrestrial hermit crab species in the world, 10 have been found to adopt human litter as a mobile shelter.\nAccording to Professor Chiu Yuh-wen (邱郁文) of National Chiayi University Department of Biological Resources, the population of conch shells for hermit crabs has drastically decreased in recent years due to over conch fishing by humans.\nAs a result, hermit crabs have resorted to adopting giant African land snail shells and even human litter as their cover, Chiu said, adding that as land snail shells are considerably lighter and thinner than conch shells, they provide less defensive functionality for hermit crabs.\nAs the Taiwan-controlled Dongsha Islands in the South China Sea lack the coral habitats required for conch species, the hermit crabs there for example, have been found living in land snail shells, Chiu added.\nConversely, the abundance of conch shells on Taiping Island means that of almost 600 C. rugosus hermit crabs collected, 81 percent resided in sturdy turban snail shells while 13 percent adopted other kinds of conch shells.\nOnly 6 percent of Taiping Island hermit crabs have resorted to taking on land snail shells while no specimens were found to be using human litter, he said, which proves Taiping Island's rich resources.\nNAMR President Chen Chung-ling (陳璋玲) revealed that due to the great distance between Taiwan proper and Taiping Island, the academy established a research station there at the end of 2021.\nThanks to funding from Taiwan's Ocean Affairs Council and continued support from the nation's Coast Guard Administration, NAMR has been able to engage in natural habitat research on the island, Chen said.\nNAMR has also shared its findings with domestic and foreign academics to establish the Taiping Island station as a center for marine life research in the South China Sea, Chen said."

About NT$129 million of the allegedly embezzled money was retrieved in March 2023 when shares owned by Liu were seized and sold.\nA re-examination of Liu's case by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office in 2021 also showed that he was suspected of surrendering to the Chinese government and espionage.\nHe is still wanted for the espionage case."

    "date": "2025-05-03",
    "content": "Taipei, May 3 (CNA) The U.S. dollar is expected to fall below the NT$30 mark in the short term, as traders anticipate that Taiwan will face pressure from the United States to allow the Taiwan dollar to appreciate, according to Lin Chi-chao (林啟超), chief economist at Cathay United Bank.\nAfter the greenback fell sharply against the Taiwan dollar on Friday, Lin told CNA that the local currency's strength is expected to persist in the short term, driven by this psychological factor.\nOn Friday, the U.S. dollar fell NT$0.953, or 3.07 percent, to NT$31.064 against the Taiwan dollar, its lowest level since Jan. 9, 2024, when it closed at NT$31.023. The loss marked the steepest single-session decline since 2002.\nThe gains made the Taiwan dollar the strongest currency in the Asian market on Friday.\nThe U.S. dollar dropped by NT$0.1247 at one point during Friday's session, but the central bank's intervention helped the American currency recover part of its losses. In a statement issued Friday evening, the central bank confirmed it had stepped in to smooth market volatility.\nIn addition to expectations of U.S. pressure for the Taiwan dollar's appreciation, Lin said a strong performance on the Taiex, the benchmark index on the main board, driven by large foreign institutional net buying, to surge 552.61 points, as well as hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates by 100 basis points this year, also contributed to the Taiwan dollar's strength on Friday.\nLin said that expected pressure from the U.S. to strengthen the Taiwan dollar largely dominated the market, as many Asian countries, including Taiwan, aimed to reduce their large trade surpluses with Washington ahead of tariff negotiations.\nReferring to the \"Plaza Accord\" signed in 1985 by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the United Kingdom, which allowed Washington to intervene to weaken the U.S. dollar, Lin said many traders in the local foreign exchange market now feared the current tariff negotiations could lead to a \"Plaza Accord 2.0.\"\nHowever, Lin said the single-session gains posted by the Taiwan dollar showed that traders had overreacted to such concerns.\nAlthough Lin forecasted that the U.S. dollar would fall below the NT$30 mark in the short term, he said the Taiwan dollar is expected to move in line with other Asian currencies in the longer term, making it unlikely for the local currency to remain singled out in the global forex market.\nIn a separate statement released Thursday, the central bank said it has not received any request from the U.S. Department of the Treasury to push for a stronger Taiwan dollar, amid speculation fueled by the currency's recent sharp rise against the U.S. dollar.\nWu Meng-tao (吳孟道), head of the sixth research division at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said Friday that the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar reflected the local currency catching up to the Japanese yen, which had risen sharply against the U.S. dollar in recent sessions.\nChung-Hua Institution for Economic Research President Lien Hsien-ming (連賢明) said that, to his knowledge, the U.S. did not require Japan to strengthen the yen during their tariff talks."

    "content": "Taipei, May 3 (CNA) Medical researchers from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and Taipei Medical University (TMU) presented key findings from their previous collaboration at a symposium on Saturday, including the potential to treat liver cancer without harming healthy cells.\nWhile conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapy often harm healthy cells, Tsai Feng-chiao (蔡丰喬), an attending physician at NTUH, said at the Taipei symposium that he and his team hope their treatment, developed over the past four years, will provide a safer, more precise alternative by targeting specific genes in liver cancer.\nUsing a comprehensive analysis of various biological data, Tsai's team found that elevated levels of three genes -- YAP, STK40, and SLK- are closely linked to liver cancer progression, often seen in late-stage patients.\nYAP is a gene that regulates body and organ size, and when it becomes disrupted in cancer cells, it can lead to \"uncontrolled cancer growth and expansion,\" Tsai explained.\nHe said current treatments cannot directly target YAP because it also plays a crucial role in regulating other healthy cells.\nSTK40 and SLK, unlike YAP, are not widely expressed in healthy cells and tend to appear primarily in dysregulated ones, Tsai said.\nHis team found that suppressing STK40 and SLK can reduce YAP activity in tumor cells and stop liver cancer cells from spreading without harming normal tissue.\n\"With the right combination of treatment strategies, we can prevent tumors from spreading uncontrollably and instead reach a state of long-term coexistence,\" Tsai said.\nThe research findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Science in mid-2021, and since then, the team has been preparing to begin animal testing, which could eventually lead to applications in humans, Tsai explained.\nTsai said that liver disease is Taiwan's \"national disease,\" noting that hepatitis B once affected one in five people in the country.\nIn 2023, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis -- often linked to hepatitis B -- claimed 3,813 lives, making it the 12th leading cause of death nationwide, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare.\nMeanwhile, 7,724 people died from liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer.\nTsai said that with interventions such as the hepatitis B vaccination, the progression from hepatitis to cirrhosis and liver cancer, as well as the incidence of all three diseases, has declined in recent years.\n\"While those [hepatitis B-targeted] treatments are highly effective, they are often less effective against liver disease and cancer caused by other factors,\" he said, adding that this gap in treatment prompted him to develop a new approach."

The TFDA noted that the levels complied with current standards: 0.01 ppm for meat and offal, and 0.04 ppm for organs like liver and kidneys.\nThis marks the first detection of ractopamine in imported pork since the market opened, shifting some public concern beyond U.S. pork to other sources.\nIn response, opposition Kuomintang lawmaker Hsu Yu-chen (許宇甄) criticized the government for being unaware of and unprepared to deal with the issue, claiming the move was a \"test run\" for broader ractopamine pork imports.\nHsu urged the government to mandate clear labeling on all pork products, including processed items, to indicate both the country of origin and whether they contain ractopamine.\nHsu Tse-yu (徐則鈺), a board member of the Consumers' Foundation, said that although the product meets safety standards, consumers may still feel uneasy. He emphasized the importance of tracing the batch to ensure public confidence.\nYang Chen-chang (楊振昌), head of occupational medicine and clinical toxicology at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, called on the government to improve policies, including mandating clearer origin labeling, so that consumers can make informed choices.\nRactopamine, a beta-agonist used to promote leanness in livestock, can cause symptoms like rapid heartbeat, tremors, or gastrointestinal discomfort if consumed in large quantities, he said, adding that although no adverse effects in humans have been documented globally, concerns about long-term exposure remain."

Premium diesel will fall to NT$25.7 per liter at CPC stations and NT$25.5 at Formosa pumps.\nCPC adjusts fuel prices weekly based on a weighted formula that factors in changes in crude oil prices -- 70 percent Dubai crude and 30 percent Brent crude.\nCPC's pricing mechanism also accounts for currency fluctuations.\nThe state-run refiner said the price cuts were prompted by a stronger local currency and a sharp drop in global crude oil prices.\nMeanwhile, Formosa Petrochemical said the recent sharp drop in crude oil prices was driven by market fears that the prolonged U.S.-China trade war could trigger a global recession and weaken demand.\nThe decline was also attributed to Saudi Arabia's plan to increase production capacity to expand its market share.\nBrent crude fell to US$60.00 per barrel last Wednesday, its lowest level in four years, according to international media reports."

C.

This follows a gradual relaxation of controls from 100 percent in 2021 to 20-50 percent in 2023, after repeated tests showed no residue.\nAccording to the TFDA pork monitoring dashboard, a 22.99-metric-ton shipment from Australia on April 29 tested positive for 0.001 parts per million (ppm) of ractopamine -- well below Taiwan's legal threshold.\nThe shipment included pig feet, intestines, jowls, skin, and liver connective tissue. The detected level complied with Taiwan's residue limits: 0.01 ppm for meat and edible parts, and 0.04 ppm for organs such as liver and kidneys.\nIt marked the first instance of ractopamine detection in imported pork since the market opened, prompting concern that the issue may extend beyond U.S. pork to other sources.\nIn response, the TFDA reaffirmed its commitment to the four guiding principles for inspections -- food safety, scientific analysis, international standards, and market surveillance -- to protect public health."

    "date": "2025-05-05",
    "content": "Taipei, May 5 (CNA) There is no room for the Taiwan dollar to rise to NT$28 against the greenback, although the U.S. dollar index (DXY) has recently slipped below the 100 mark, sparking fears of a potential currency war, a foreign exchange analyst has said.\nAfter U.S. President Donald Trump announced on April 2 high \"reciprocal\" tariffs against many countries that have large trade surpluses with the U.S., including Taiwan, the DXY dropped nearly 3 percent in just 24 hours to 101.27, and it has since slid below the 100-mark as world markets react to the U.S. tariffs.\nIn Asia, as of the end of April, the Japanese yen had strengthened nearly 10 percent against the U.S. dollar, while the Korean won had surged 3.61 percent, and the Taiwan dollar had risen 2.39 percent.\nA foreign exchange analyst, who spoke to CNA recently on condition of anonymity, noted that Taiwan's central bank said on May 1 that it had not received any request from the U.S. Treasury Department to push for an appreciation of the Taiwan dollar.\nFurthermore, the analyst said, the market does not appear to be lined up for such a rise.\nIntervention by Taiwan's central bank in the currency exchange rate has always been something that can be done but not openly acknowledged, given that Taiwan was included last November on the U.S. Treasury Department's currency \"watch list\" for the sixth consecutive time, according to the analyst.\nThe listing was based on criteria established under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, which evaluates the foreign exchange practices of the U.S.' major trading partners to see if any of them are engaged in currency devaluation practices.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department uses three criteria to assess potential currency manipulation -- a bilateral trade surplus of at least US$15 billion with the U.S.; a material current account surplus of at least 3 percent of GDP; and evidence of persistent, one-sided foreign exchange intervention.\nTaiwan currently meets the first two criteria, which means it is likely to remain on the watch list, according to the central bank.\nThe analyst said that until the Treasury Department's next semiannual report is released, Taiwan's central bank will remain cautious about any intervention to stabilize the local currency exchange rate.\nThe Taiwan dollar has soared sharply recently, amid expected pressure from the U.S. for appreciation of the currency.\nAt one point on Monday morning, the Taiwan dollar was trading at NT$29.675 against the greenback on the Taipei Foreign Exchange, up NT$1.389 from the previous close.\nLast Friday, the Taiwan dollar rose NT$0.953, or 3.07 percent, to NT$31.064, its highest level since Jan. 9, 2024, when it closed at NT$31.023.\nWhile Trump is likely to push Taiwan for a further appreciation of its currency, there is no consensus in the foreign exchange market on how high it might rise against the U.S. dollar, given Trump's unpredictability, the analyst said.\nThe analyst expressed the view, however, that \"there is no room for appreciation to NT$28.00\" against the U.S. currency.\nMeanwhile, Chen Yu-chung (陳有忠), a foreign exchange analyst at Taishin International Bank, said Taiwan had previously experienced an outflow of hot money due to uncertainty surrounding Trump's aggressive tariff policy.\nChen noted that trade tensions have eased somewhat since Trump announced on April 9 a 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs, while maintaining a baseline universal tariff of 10 percent for most countries, except China.\nAs a result, the greenback has been sliding, while Taiwan's stocks have staged a rebound, and foreign investors have turned to net buying, Chen noted, adding that all of these factors have helped to boost the Taiwan dollar.\nHowever, market fears remain about the ongoing tariff war and a potential currency war, he said."

    "date": "2025-05-05",
    "content": "Taipei, May 5 (CNA) Export-oriented semiconductor and auto part manufacturers are expecting their margins to be affected by large foreign exchange losses as the Taiwan dollar continued to appreciate sharply against the U.S. dollar on Monday morning.\nAmong major semiconductor manufacturers, ASE Technology Holding Co., the world's largest IC packaging and testing services provider, told CNA that whenever the Taiwan dollar rises NT$1 against the greenback, its gross margin is cut by about 1.5 percentage points.\nThe U.S. dollar closed the morning down NT$1.114, or 3.71 percent, at NT$29.950 Tuesday after falling 3.07 percent to end at NT$31.064 on Friday. The losses Friday were the steepest single-day decline of the American currency since 2002.\nDealers said the rapid appreciation of the Taiwan dollar reflected expectations that the United States will press Taiwan to boost its currency against the U.S. dollar in a bid to strengthen the competitive edge of goods made in the U.S.\nThe pressure was expected to emerge during negotiations between Taipei and Washington as they discuss a so-called \"reciprocal\" tariff of 32 percent the Trump administration threatened on April 2 to impose against goods from Taiwan.\nASE Technology's response to the exchange rate volatility echoed that of contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and its smaller rival United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), which also said they would be hurt by a stronger Taiwan dollar.\nTSMC said that whenever the Taiwan dollar rises 1 percent, its operating margin -- -- the difference between sales and its operating expenses -- could move lower by 0.4 percentage points, while UMC said its gross margin -- the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold -- could also drop by 0.4 percentage points.\nAt an investor conference held in mid-April, TSMC forecast that its operating margin would range between 47 and 49 percent in the second quarter, compared with 48.5 percent in the first quarter, based on an assumption of an exchange rate of NT$32.5 to one U.S. dollar.\nA source from the local semiconductor industry said that with the Taiwan dollar suddenly appreciating against the U.S. dollar, the local semiconductor and overall electronics sectors face challenges on how to effectively hedge against foreign exchange risks.\nTaiwanese tech exporters will also see their bargaining power tested as the value of the Taiwan dollar rises because their clients will likely request that they adjust their prices accordingly, the source said.\nSemiconductor suppliers in the upstream part of the supply chain, such as TSMC, could have greater bargaining power in pricing negotiations, the source said.\nUnlike IC makers, auto part manufacturers, who run relatively low profit margins, could see their profitability be more adversely affected by the rapidly appreciating Taiwan dollar.\nThe Tong Yang Group, an aftermarket (AM) replacement auto part supplier, said it was able to take on short-term volatility in the forex market but if the strong Taiwan dollar continued for longer, the impact on its bottom line would be big.\nA source from the auto parts industry said the rapid appreciation of the Taiwan dollar is expected to affect the industry's profitability in the second quarter.\nAn investment consulting analyst said, meanwhile, that many Taiwanese exporters adopt the so-called natural hedging practice to ease forex impact.\nAmong common methods in natural hedging is to match revenues and expenses or invoice in the local currency, the analyst said, adding that the impact from a stronger Taiwan dollar will vary from industry to industry."

    "content": "Taipei, May 5 (CNA) The Legislative Yuan's Internal Administration Committee on Monday passed a preliminary review of amendments to the Social Order Maintenance Act to raise penalties for ticket scalping, noise disturbances and stalking offenses.\nSpecifically, the maximum fine for unauthorized reselling of transportation or entertainment tickets not intended for personal use will be increased from NT$18,000 to NT$30,000.\nThe committee also approved a resolution calling on the relevant authorities to propose legal amendments within two months targeting the scalping of medical, hospitality, and other voucher-based products and services.\nThe resolution stated that while the Social Order Maintenance Act generally handles minor offenses through administrative penalties, scalping can involve \"substantial illegal gains and seriously harm the interests of consumers.\"\nThe changes were proposed by committee members Lo Ting-wei (羅廷瑋), Wang Hung-wei (王鴻薇), and Lin Szu-ming (林思銘) of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) alongside Kao Chin Su-mei (高金素梅), a lawmaker without party affiliation.\nOpposing the proposed changes, Interior Minister Liu Shyh-fang (劉世芳) said at the meeting that the scalping of tickets for cultural and sports events was already covered under the Development of the Cultural and Creative Industries Act and the Sports Industry Development Act.\nLiu said the illegal reselling of medical and hospitality vouchers should be regulated under separate laws set by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to \"avoid excessive administrative discretion by police.\"\nLiu also warned against listing multiple kinds of ticket type in the law, saying it risked overlooking some categories.\nSeparately, the committee approved a clause raising the maximum fine for creating noise disturbances from NT$6,000 to NT$10,000.\nThe proposal was introduced by the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) legislative caucus and KMT lawmaker Chiu Jo-hua (邱若華), who suggested that current fines are too low to serve as an effective deterrent.\nIn another amendment, KMT lawmakers Lu Ming-che (魯明哲) and Yen Kuan-heng (顏寬恒) proposed raising the fine for the offense of \"stalking another person without justifiable reasons despite having been dissuaded\" from NT$3,000 to NT$30,000.\nThe 14-member standing committee approved the proposed increases following cross-party discussions."

    "title": "Children of older fathers more likely to develop schizophrenia: NHRI study",
    "date": "2025-05-05",
    "content": "Taipei, May 5 (CNA) Scientists in Taiwan have used genome sequencing to show that men who become fathers at a later age are more likely to pass along new mutations that put their children at a higher risk of developing schizophrenia.\nThe study, conducted by researchers at the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) and National Taiwan University, was published in the scientific journal Molecular Psychiatry in March.\nAt a press conference Monday, NHRI Vice President Wei J. Chen (陳為堅) said that while the risks of geriatric pregnancies are widely studied, there has been comparatively little research on how paternal age affects children's health.\nWang Shi-heng (王世亨), an assistant researcher at the NHRI's National Center for Geriatrics and Welfare Research, explained that the NHRI had previously examined links between paternal age and schizophrenia by analyzing over 7 million Taiwanese medical records.\nIt found that children whose father was aged 25-29 at the time of their birth had a 0.5 percent chance of developing schizophrenia during their lifetimes, while those born to fathers aged 50 or above had a 1 percent chance, Wang said.\nIn cases where the grandfather on either side of the family was also at an advanced age when the child's father or mother was born, there was an even higher risk of the child developing schizophrenia, he said.\nWang said that two explanations have been offered for why this occurs, with the first being that men with a higher risk of mental illness simply happen to marry and have children at a later age.\nA second hypothesis is that because men's sperm cells are continuously produced throughout their lives, and each division carries a higher chance of errors leading to new gene mutations, older fathers are more likely to pass the relevant mutations on to their children, he said.\nThis latter explanation is bolstered by other factors, including evidence that an increased number of rare mutations is associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia, and that men pass on four times as many new genetic mutations as women, he said.\nIn an effort to prove a causal relationship, the NHRI team performed whole-genome sequencing on five Taiwanese families, each comprising three siblings affected by schizophrenia and two healthy parents, Wang said.\nThey found that for every year a man delayed having children, their child had 1.5 times more de novo, or new, gene mutations. Moreover, the more such mutations a child had, the earlier in life they began to experience symptoms of schizophrenia, Wang said.\nIn quantifiable terms, the team's analyses showed that 30 percent of the observed association between paternal age and the onset age of schizophrenia might be mediated by paternal age-related mutations, while the other 70 percent is attributable to their family and social environment, Wang said.\nChen, meanwhile, noted that previous NHRI research has shown that a paternal age below 20 is associated with multiple other risks for the child.\nTaken together, these studies highlight the importance of government policies that encourage couples to have children at a suitable age, he said.\nIn Taiwan, the average age of mothers at childbirth has risen by 5.2 years, from 27.2 to 32.4, between 1991 and 2023, while the average age of fathers rose by 4.3 years, from 30.3 to 34.6, Interior Ministry data shows."

When questioned by the police, the two admitted that they went there to withdraw money on Su's instructions, according to a recent court document.\nAfter learning of this, Su asked Yang and Chen to change their statement and tell police that they did not go to withdraw the money under his instructions.\nYang demanded that Su pay them NT$8 million (US$268,200) if he wanted them to change their statement.\nAngered by the request, Su bought a modified pistol and bullets from an unknown person and brought them to a rental suite in Taoyuan where he met with Yang, Chen and others on the evening of Sept. 1, 2022.\nAfter Su showed his gun, the others left and he immediately got into an argument with Yang and Chen.\nHe first fired two shots at Yang's right temple and the top of his head, killing him on the spot, before shooting Chen in his right temple, leading to his immediate death, according to court rulings."

He was driving under the influence and did not stop to check on the men he hit, instead running a red light when a bystander chased after the car.\nThe prosecutors said in the indictment that Kui had been drinking from midnight to 4 a.m. before he drove to a friend's residence in Keelung.\nKui did not report the incident to the police and failed to call the emergency services, nor did he stay at the scene or perform first aid, the prosecutors said.\nChen suffered contusions while Lee underwent emergency surgeries before dying in hospital on Jan. 3, said the prosecutors, who summoned Kui for questioning on Jan. 7 and secured approval from a court to detain the singer.\nHe has since been held incommunicado and the court granted a prosecution motion to extend the detention in late February.\nBecause Kui's alleged actions led to the taxi driver's death, he will be tried by a panel of six citizen judges and three professional judges.\nSince Jan. 1, 2023, citizen judges in Taiwan have participated in trials where defendants are accused of intentionally committing crimes that result in loss of life."

It would need to be approved by the Senate and signed by the president to become law.\nAfter severing ties with Taiwan, officially named the Republic of China (ROC), in 1979, Washington developed guidelines to limit official interactions with Taiwan to avoid angering the People's Republic of China (PRC), which sees Taiwan as part of its territory.\nThese guidelines have included banning senior American executive branch officials, including high-ranking military officers, from visiting Taiwan, while also blocking Taiwan's top leaders from traveling to the U.S.\nAlso, meetings between officials from the two sides have had to meet a list of requirements, such as being held at venues other than in official federal buildings or asking Taiwanese officials not to wear any official uniforms or insignia.\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo removed the guidelines in the final month of Donald Trump's first term as president, but many were later put back in place during the Joe Biden administration.\nTaiwan International Solidarity Act\nThe second piece of legislation consists of amendments to the TAIPEI Act of 2019, which instructs the U.S. government to support Taiwan's membership in international organizations and encourage other countries to strengthen their official or unofficial ties to Taiwan.\nThe new bill, called the Taiwan International Solidarity Act, would add language to \"clarify\" that U.N. Resolution 2758 did not address the issue of the representation of Taiwan or its people in the United Nations or related organizations.\nApproved in 1971, U.N. Resolution 2758 recognized the PRC as the only legitimate government of China, and expelled \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石).\" Chiang was the then-leader of the ROC, which governs Taiwan.\nThe bill would also expand reporting requirements in the TAIPEI Act to include information on China's efforts to undermine Taiwan's international participation and its ties or relationships with other countries.\nVersions of both the bills approved Monday were previously passed by the House in 2023 but were not taken up by the Senate, and thus had to be reintroduced after the new Congress was seated on Jan. 3."

    "content": "Taipei, May 6 (CNA) A visiting former Japanese economics minister told CNA Monday that Japan, Taiwan and the United States are establishing closer trilateral cooperation in the semiconductor industry, forming what he called a \"semiconductor iron triangle.\"\nDuring an interview with CNA, former Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yasutoshi Nishimura, a current member of the lower house of Japan's Diet, said he came up with the phrase \"semiconductor iron triangle\" based on the fact that global semiconductor powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) has a presence in both Japan and the U.S.\nTSMC has a factory in Kumamoto and is building chip fabs in Arizona, Nishimura said. Therefore, TSMC's Arizona factory is using Japan-made manufacturing devices and materials, according to him.\nThat is why the trilateral cooperation in building advanced semiconductors is heading in the right direction in strengthening global supply chains, he added.\nIn the future, Nishimura said he hopes with joint collaboration in advanced chips, Japan, Taiwan and the U.S. can work closely in areas spanning 5G, self-driving automobile and generative artificial intelligence, among others.\nNishimura made the comments when asked by CNA to elaborate on his \"semiconductor iron triangle\" idea which he first proposed during a speech to overseas Taiwanese in Japan in April.\nDuring that speech on April 13, Nishimura said Taiwan, Japan and the U.S. need to closely unite to promote semiconductor development to jointly face an \"arch enemy that steals semiconductor technology for military use,\" referring to China.\nThe 62-year-old Japanese politician previously served as minister of state for economic and fiscal policy and minister of economic revitalization. He promoted bilateral cooperation between Japan and Taiwan in the semiconductor industry while heading the economy and trade office from 2022-2023.\nOther than semiconductors and high-tech, the visiting Japanese Diet member also proposed closer Tokyo-Taipei exchanges in the energy sector.\nJapan is set to take advantage of renewable energy and nuclear energy to make sure it has sufficient power supply in pushing for the advancement of new technologies, he said.\nWhile Taiwan is phasing out nuclear energy, Taiwan and Japan can still work on renewable energy resources including solar, wind, hydrogen energy, and storage batteries, he added.\nNishimura is leading a five-member parliamentary delegation from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from Saturday through Tuesday, during which he has met President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) and Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim (蕭美琴).\nNishimura is joined by four other LDP representatives: Kosaburo Nishime, Kazuo Yana, Hajime Sasaki and Ryusho Kato, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)."

    "content": "Taipei, May 6 (CNA) President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) reassured the public that recent rapid appreciation of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar was primarily caused by market speculation in conjunction with Taiwan-U.S. talks on tariffs, but his administration would safeguard national interests in negotiations.\nIn a recorded speech, Lai said on Monday he regrets that market rumors have prompted the public to dump U.S. dollars, rapidly pushing up the Taiwan dollar on Friday and Monday, with the local currency soaring 6.21 percent against the greenback in just two trading sessions.\nLocal news media cited analysts as saying that expected pressure from the United States to strengthen the Taiwan dollar largely dominated the market, as many Asian countries -- including Taiwan -- aim to reduce their large trade surpluses with Washington ahead of upcoming talks with the U.S.\nLai refuted the market rumor, saying that the latest round of bilateral trade talks did not involve currency issues.\nIn a statement issued on Monday, the Executive Yuan's Office of Trade Negotiation also stressed that the trade talks concluded on May 1 (U.S. time) in Washington D.C., the first in-person meeting on tariffs between both sides, did not include currency issues.\nTaiwan's strong economic performance and healthy forecast were why the forex market expected stronger Taiwan dollar, Lai said, citing the latest GDP data, which showed robust growth of 5.37 percent in the first quarter of this year, following a 4.59 percent increase for all of 2024.\nThe president said the International Monetary Fund even raised its forecast for Taiwan's GDP growth from 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent for 2025, while downgrading its forecasts for neighboring economies such as Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.\nLai urged the people of Taiwan to remain confident in the local economy, even though the impact of a stronger Taiwan dollar may vary across industries.\nMeanwhile, Lai said the large trade surplus Taiwan enjoys with the U.S. is not related to currency as it broadly reflects strong demand from American buyers for Taiwan-made high-tech gadgets such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence applications and information and communications devices.\nThe president said Taiwan is at a critical moment in terms of tariff talks with the U.S., adding when the government's negotiating team faces its American counterpart, Taiwanese negotiators are determined to safeguard the national interest, protect industrial development and not sacrifice any industry.\nAlthough Taiwan was unable to isolate itself from the turbulence on global financial markets after Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, Lai said, the Taiex, the benchmark on the Taiwan Stock Exchange has recovered and returned to 20,000 points after plunging to 17,391.76 on April 9 as foreign institutional investors resumed their buying.\nLai emphasized Taiwan has never been named a currency manipulator by the U.S. so the tariff talks did not touch on the currency issue, urging people with bad intentions not to spread market rumors.\nHowever, Taiwan was named a currency manipulator in 1988 and 1992, and as recently as 2024 was on a monitoring list of currency manipulation."

Turnover totaled NT$302.92 billion (US$10.04 billion).\nAfter opening down 179.11 points, the market rallied and rose to the day's high just before noon. But selling set in and escalated late in the trading session, with large cap semiconductor stocks in focus, to push the Taiex into negative territory, dealers said.\n\"The initial gains came after the Taiwan dollar stabilized, leaving rapid appreciation against the greenback behind,\" Mega International Investment Services analyst Alex Huang said.\n\"Investors seemed relived to some extent after the central bank, the largest player in Taiwan's currency market, said volatility was over.\"\nThe U.S. dollar plunged 6.21 percent Friday and Monday, sparking a sell-off on the stock market amid worries over potentially big foreign exchange losses suffered by Taiwanese exporters.\nReversing its steep fall in the previous two sessions, however, the greenback rose NT$0.135 Tuesday to close at NT$30.280.\n\"But, possible tariffs on semiconductors returned to hurt sentiment. So TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) came under pressure, dragging the broader market lower,\" Huang said.\nContract chipmaker TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock here, lost 1.92 percent to close at NT$920.00. Its losses sent the electronics index 0.50 percent lower and the semiconductor sub-index 1.49 percent lower.\nAmong other semiconductor stocks, smartphone IC designer MediaTek Inc. fell 1.16 percent to end at NT$1,280.00, and Global Unichip Corp., TSMC's application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design subsidiary, shed 3.59 percent to close at NT$1,075.00. Bucking the downturn, IC packaging and testing services provider ASE Technology Holding Co. rose 1.87 percent to close at NT$136.50.\nA stable Taiwan dollar drew buying in tech hardware suppliers.\niPhone assembler and artificial intelligence server maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. closed 2.46 percent higher at NT$146.00, and Quanta Computer Inc., another AI server supplier, rose 3.04 percent to end at NT$254.00.\nThe currency issue also lent support to the financial sector, which rose 1.21 percent, amid eased concerns over a decline in the value of insurance companies' assets in foreign markets, dealers said.\nCathay Financial Holding Co. gained 2.19 percent to close at NT$55.90, and E. Sun Financial Holding Co. added 2.69 percent to end at NT$28.60, while Fubon Financial Holding Co. lost 1.25 percent to close at NT$79.00.\nAirline stocks rode the wave of a higher Taiwan dollar, which could give local consumers an extra incentive to travel overseas.\nChina Airlines rose 3.15 percent to end at NT$22.90, and EVA Airways gained 5.35 percent to close at NT$43.35. Tigerair Taiwan soared 10 percent, the maximum daily increase, to end at NT$103.50.\n\"In addition to the currency issue, investors should follow the Federal Reserve policymaking meeting (slated to open later in the day),\" Huang said.\nAccording to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, foreign institutional investors bought a net NT$15.75 billion in shares on the market Tuesday."

This year's Han Kuang exercises will be held from July 9-18, according to the MND.\nHsia Chen-kuo (夏振國), deputy head of the All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency's Mobilization Management Division, said more than 20,000 reservists will be mobilized in the Tung Hsin exercise, meaning there will be at least 5,000 more reservists engaging in the drill this year.\nReservists participating in the drill will be trained to fire pistols and rifles in standing, kneeling, and prone positions to help them become familiar with real-world combat scenarios, Hsia noted.\nThe higher number of reservists set to be mobilized in the drill is partly due to an increase in the members of regional reserve brigades, Hsia added.\nIncreasing the number of reservists participating in the drill is also consistent with the MND's policy goal of \"transforming\" the reserve force into a more combat-ready branch of the military, Chou said.\nAmong the MND's major policy goals are boosting the joint combat and training capabilities of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, holding more realistic drills to better approximate battlefield situations, and strengthening cooperation between the Armed Forces and civilians, according to Chou.\nOther major goals include achieving autonomy in national defense technologies, building a complete \"national defense supply chain,\" expanding international collaborations and exchanges regarding defense affairs, and retaining high-caliber talent in the military, Chou said."

It also said it had shot down five Indian Air Force jets.\nOn Wednesday, Taiwanese carrier China Airlines (CAL) issued some guidelines for its passengers and those booked with the subsidiary Mandarin Airlines, who may have been affected by the flight cancellations and delays.\nPassengers holding tickets for CAL flights between Taiwan and Europe can change their flights once free of cost, if they were booked to travel after May 6 on flights that have now been canceled or delayed for more than two hours, according to the airline.\nThe free changes apply only in cases where the passenger does not change the route or the flight class, CAL said, adding that the handling and service fees for those flights will be also be waived.\nPassengers who wish to cancel their flights will receive full refunds for any payments for seat selection or extra luggage, the airline said."

Upholding the truth is part of this.\"\nHe said this means pushing back against \"the distortion of historical facts, revisionism, and political instrumentalization.\"\nVE Day commemorates the unconditional surrender of Germany's military forces to the Allies on May 8, 1945. For months after VE Day, the war continued in the Asia-Pacific region and only came to an end after the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nVictory over Japan Day commemorates the surrender of Japanese forces on Aug. 15, 1945, which effectively ended WWII.\nThe Republic of China (ROC) -- as Taiwan is officially designated -- previously only commemorated the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, which was marked on Sept. 3, 1945. On that day, Japan delivered a letter of surrender to the ROC government, which was based in Nanjing at the time.\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the ROC and the Empire of Japan 1937-1945. It is considered part of World War II (1939-1945) and is often regarded in Asia as the start of that war.\nThe ROC was based in mainland China when the Second Sino-Japanese War began. It officially declared war against Japan, Germany and Italy in 1941, after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.\nThe ROC government, led by Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正) of the Kuomintang, relocated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's (毛澤東) Chinese Communist Party, which established the People's Republic of China in Beijing that same year.\nTaiwan's military announced in March that it planned to hold art exhibitions and a concert, among other events, to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II."

When you see sparks, you have to move quickly to put them out,\" he said.\nFollowing the recent volatility, market expectations that the Taiwan dollar will rise further have eased, and a more stable equilibrium between supply and demand for the currency has prevailed, Yang said.\nCurrently, the Taiwan dollar is trading at around NT$30, which historically has happened \"quite a few times,\" he added."

    "date": "2025-05-08",
    "content": "By Joseph Yeh, staff reporter\nRecent discoveries of people within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government spying for China have exposed potential flaws in Taiwan's security vetting system and highlighted the difficulties involved in fixing them.\nThe scandal over the alleged Chinese spy network within Taiwan's government that has blown up in recent months has largely involved aides to senior national security officials and other prominent figures in power.\nOne of them was Ho Jen-chieh (何仁傑), who worked for Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) when he was National Security Council (NSC) secretary-general from May 2016 to May 2017, Presidential Office secretary-general from May 2017 to February 2018, and foreign minister from 2018 to 2024.\nHo was arrested and detained on April 11.\nOther suspects in the case include Wu Shang-yu (吳尚雨), who worked as an adviser in President Lai Ching-te's (賴清德) office; Chiu Shih-yuan (邱世元), former deputy head of the DPP's Taiwan Institute of Democracy, and Huang Chu-jung (黃取榮), an aide to DPP New Taipei Councilor Lee Yu-tien (李余典).\nProsecutors believe that Huang was at the center of the large-scale espionage operation within the ruling DPP government, which has been in power since May 2016.\nHe is thought to have been recruited by Chinese intelligence services when he was doing business in China, and he started working with Ho, Wu Shang-yu and Chiu soon after returning to Taiwan.\nTheir goal was to gather confidential information about Lai's trips, including flight schedules, accommodation, and meeting locations and lists, in exchange for tens of thousands of Taiwan dollars, according to prosecutors.\nWhat was different, though not unprecedented, about this spy scandal was that it largely involved political staffers and civilians rather than military or intelligence personnel, among whom most Chinese spy cases have been concentrated.\nWhile Taiwan has anti-espionage laws and is in the process of amending them to prevent the recurrence of future cases, the alleged spy network within the DPP has exposed vulnerabilities in the existing system that could lead to more such cases.\nAt the top of the list is the vetting system for people with access to confidential information. In the latest spy case, some political workers who later became aides for top officials were vetted based on legal requirements but still fell through the cracks.\nIn Ho's case, for example, he was vetted in 2016 when Joseph Wu was about to serve as NSC secretary-general.\nInvestigation Bureau Director-General Michael Chen (陳白立) said in mid-April that Ho received a more rigorous \"special background check\" before working for Wu that year.\nHo then underwent an additional standard background and security check in 2018 before he was hired as a senior level contract-based assistant to then-Foreign Minister Wu, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) told CNA in a statement.\nRange of vettingAccording to a list contained within a law on officials subject to special background checks, there are 1,328 positions that require such vetting, most of them involved in national security or major national interests, including 96 at MOFA.These positions are determined based on each individual agency's own list that has to be approved by the Presidential Office, the NSC and the government body they are under.Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), a division director at the Taiwan military-funded think tank Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told CNA that MOFA did the background check on Ho by the book in accordance with the Public Servants Appointment Act.The act only stipulates, however, that a background check should be done before hiring a person to work in a public office. It does not stipulate follow-up checks after a person has taken up the post, Su said.Of course, figuring out who does and who does not have access to confidential information is also a problem, especially given the vagueness of the laws and standards.Ho, for example, may not have reached the threshold for a thorough background check at MOFA, but Legislator Huang Kuo-chang (黃國昌) of the Taiwan People's Party said he was told by somebody at MOFA that Ho was the first person to see faxes sent directly from Taiwan's representative office in Washington, D.C.That was why DPP lawmaker Chen Kuan-ting (陳冠廷), a member of the Legislature's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, proposed to the Ministry of Justice that it revise laws to establish a more comprehensive national security vetting procedure.DPP lawmaker Chen Kuan-ting. CNA file photoSuch a system would particularly target top officials' assistants and political appointees, said Chen, who also pushed to establish rules for vetting lawmakers' aides.According to Chen, all legislative aides are currently hired based on the Labor Standards Act and none of them have to pass even the most basic security and background checks in accordance with the Public Servants Appointment Act and/or National Intelligence Act even though their jobs give them access to confidential information.Separately, the government is planning to expand the scope of special background checks to include an additional 1,008 positions, most of them at the level of aides or contracted workers who might have access to confidential information.Alexander Huang (黃介正), chair of the Taipei-based think tank Council on Strategic & Wargaming Studies, said governments need to be determined to take security clearances seriously and build a long-term system that applies to all because it costs money and time.\"Do the politicians at the top really want to wait so long for their preferred candidate to take office...for fear of being manipulated by unnecessary politics or disruption [before taking office].\" he said.Alexander Huang, chair of the Taipei-based think tank Council on Strategic & Wargaming Studies. CNA photo May 8, 2025One way Su proposed to enhance the security vetting system was for each government unit to add a more in-depth security clearance process before hiring a person, especially those who work closely with a senior official who has access to more confidential and sensitive information.That would not be too difficult because each government unit only has to update their own administrative order accordingly without the need to go through a lawmaking process, according to Su.More important than a pre-recruitment check, however, are regular follow-up screenings of all staffers who work closely with senior officials, which could involve the assistance of technology such as lie detectors, he said.Cultural differences?Meanwhile, Huang, who served as deputy chief of the Mainland Affairs Council under the previous DPP administration and now heads international affairs for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), suggested that cultural differences between the two parties may partly explain the recent espionage scandal.He told CNA that the DPP often hires close aides from campaign team workers with diverse, sometimes murky connections, while the KMT typically appoints bureaucrats vetted through internal personnel systems.\"Such complex networks, including ties to business or even organized crime, can create openings for the PRC to exploit personal relationships,\" Huang said.Junzhi Wu (吳峻鋕), director of DPP's China Affairs Department, disagreed with Huang's assessment.He said other countries in the world have cracked down on a number of large-scale Chinese espionage operations in recent years, and the latest incidents highlighted that Chinese intelligence activity abroad has continued to intensify over the years.Instead of blaming the DPP and tying the ruling party to a Chinese spy network, it is more important for all parties in Taiwan to reinforce the country's anti-espionage measures, Wu said.Enditem/ls"

Resolution 2758 \"brooks no challenge,\" Xi wrote in the piece.\nIn a response issued Thursday, MOFA condemned the article as a \"fallacy\" that \"confused right and wrong and is contrary to the facts.\"\nIt noted that at the time of the Cairo Declaration in 1943 and the Potsdam Declaration in 1945, the People's Republic of China (PRC) did not even exist.\nRather, the status of Taiwan, Penghu and affiliated islands after World War II was resolved by those documents and others, including the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951 and the Treaty of Taipei (the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty) in 1952, MOFA said.\nAll of these documents followed a practice set down in the Cairo Declaration, that Taiwan and its affiliated islands, including the contested Diaoyutai Islands, should be returned to the Republic of China (ROC), MOFA said.\nAs for U.N. Resolution 2758, MOFA noted that the resolution's text does not mention Taiwan or state that Taiwan is a part of the PRC.\nIn legal terms, it does not authorize the PRC to represent Taiwan in the United Nations or U.N. agencies, MOFA said.\nApproved in 1971, U.N. Resolution 2758 recognized the PRC as the only legitimate government of China, and expelled \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石).\" Chiang was the then-leader of the ROC, which governs Taiwan.\nMOFA went on to say that Beijing's attempts to distort historical facts and mislead the international community with its one-China principle were intended to \"legally eliminate the fact that the Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign state\" along with its right to participate in the U.N. system.\nXi's article, entitled \"Learning from History to Build Together a Brighter Future,\" was published ahead of his planned attendance at Victory in Europe (VE) Day celebrations in Moscow on May 9.\nRussia celebrates VE Day on May 9 because it was after midnight in Moscow when the ceasefire ending the war came into force in Berlin just after 11 p.m. on May 8, 1945.\nTaiwan, meanwhile, commemorated VE Day for the first time on Thursday at a reception in Taipei attended by President Lai Ching-te (賴清德)."

It therefore granted the prosecution's request for detention.\nDuring questioning, Wu admitted to taking part in recall efforts against ruling Democratic Progressive Party city councilors Cheng Wen-ting (鄭文婷) and Jiho Tiun (張之豪) of Keelung's Ren'ai and Anle districts.\nAlthough Wu denied the charges brought by prosecutors, his statements were contradictory and failed to reasonably explain the irregularities in the recall petitions, the court said.\nProsecutors raided the KMT Keelung branch Thursday, taking Wu and the branch's deputy secretary, Han Chi-yuan (韓吉元), in for questioning. Han was later released on NT$100,000 (US$3,297) bail.\nProsecutors cross-examined conversations in a WeChat group with the defendants' statements to determine whether Wu was aware of the forgeries.\nThe group included Wu, Han and Chang Yuan-hsiang (張淵翔), former director of the Keelung City government's Department of Civil Affairs, who was detained Tuesday on the same charges.\nBefore the Thursday raid, the KMT branch office was searched on April 28, and Chi Wen-chuan (紀文荃) and Yu Cheng-yi (游正義), the chief petitioners in the recall campaign against Cheng and Tiun, were brought in for investigation.\nCheng was later released on a NT$150,000 bail, and Chi was detained and held incommunicado."

General Assembly Resolution 2758.\nIt explicitly expelled \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" (蔣介石) -- the leader of the ROC government at the time -- and recognized the representatives of the People's Republic of China as the \"only legitimate representatives of China.\"\nSince then, Taiwan has been shut out from the WHA due to Beijing's pressure, except from 2009 to 2016 as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\" when relations with China were warmer under Taiwan's then-Kuomintang government.\nIt also attended in 2016, just days after former President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) of the Democratic Progressive Party took office, but has not participated since.\nDuring the 2009-2016 period, the medical and other activist groups were still engaged in the process but were primarily focused on changing Taiwan's \"Chinese Taipei\" designation at the WHA to \"Taiwan.\""

    "content": "Taipei, May 9 (CNA) The family of an Indonesian fisher who died on a Taiwanese fishing boat in 2015 has settled a civil lawsuit with the ship's captain and the chief engineer for an undisclosed amount, according to the Taiwan International Workers' Association (TIWA).\nThe family of Supriyanto, a 43-year-old Indonesian migrant worker who died on the Kaohsiung-registered longline fishing vessel \"Fu Tsz Chiun\" on Aug. 25, 2015, reached a settlement mediated by the Pingtung District Court through legal counsel Tseng Wei-kai (曾威凱) Thursday, TIWA said in a statement.\nThe Indonesian national died of septicemia after being allegedly assaulted by the captain and chief engineer and then not receiving treatment in a timely manner.\nSeveral fishing worker rights groups have worked on the case over the past 10 years to help secure the settlement, said TIWA, which took on the case in December 2016.\nMeanwhile, Tseng said in TIWA's statement that he felt relieved after closing an eight-year legal battle that started with the criminal case he filed in June 2017.\nSupriyanto's younger sister named Rusmiati appeared in the court as a witness on Sept. 26, 2024, and was asked about whether the family was willing to settle the civil case, according to TIWA.\nOn Friday, Tseng told CNA that the Pingtung District Prosecutors Office running the criminal case against \"Fu Tsz Chiun\" captain Chen Kai-chih (陳凱治) and chief engineer Chen Chin-piao (陳金錶) will be notified of the settlement, the amount of which was not disclosed.\nThe Pingtung District Prosecutors Office will decide how to proceed with the criminal case it reopened in 2016, according to Tseng.\nThe death of Supriyanto was initially ruled \"accidental\" by the Pingtung District Prosecutors Office in 2015.\nBut the Control Yuan, the watchdog arm of the government, found video clips that showed Supriyanto's complaints of abuse were not correctly translated and not taken into account as a result.\n\"The captain stalked me and beat me. It's abuse!\" Supriyanto said in a clip filmed by fellow crew member Mualip, according to the Control Yuan.\nThe Pingtung District Prosecutors Office reopened the case in December 2016, but TIWA said it has since been an arduous process to make the case that has included calling witnesses who traveled from Indonesia to Taiwan.\nIndictments were handed down on Aug. 23, 2023 against the captain for negligent homicide and assault and against the chief engineer and another Indonesian fisher named Agus Setiawan for assaulting and abusing Supriyanto, which Supriyanto complained about before he died.\nIndonesian Munawir Sazali, who also worked on the Taiwanese longliner and was allegedly involved in the abuse of Supriyanto, remains wanted by the authorities after he fled Taiwan, according to the statement."

    "content": "Los Angeles, May 8 (CNA) Two spirits produced by a Taiwanese distillery using Taiwan-grown rice received unanimous recognition at the 2025 San Francisco World Spirits Competition, the largest event of its kind in North America.\nThe spirits produced by Heng Chi Distillery earned Double Gold -- an honor awarded to entries that receive top marks from all judges -- at the mid-April event. The results of the competition, organized by The Tasting Alliance, were made public on Thursday.\n\"If we want [our products] to be recognized internationally, we must produce high-value spirits,\" Lo I-neng (羅已能), a Heng Chi representative, told CNA on Thursday.\nThe award-winning products were Shoufeng Voyage 3, made with rice from Shoufeng Township in Hualien County, and Pocael 194 Rice Spirit, made with rice from the Hsinchu area.\nLo said that the rice from Shoufeng was a variety introduced from Japan during Taiwan's Japanese colonial period, and that Hsinchu rice has long been praised for its high quality as a food staple.\nThe success of the drink made with Hsinchu rice \"proves that even rice not specifically cultivated for alcohol production can earn international recognition,\" Lo said, adding that many other Taiwanese rice varieties could have similar potential.\n\"Taiwan's land and its rice could gain global visibility with the right craftsmanship,\" Lo said, adding that this could open more opportunities for Taiwanese farmers and others in the agricultural industry.\nWhile sake is the most familiar rice-based drink, Lo said Taiwan's climate isn't ideal for brewing it. Instead, distilling locally grown rice into base spirits offers more possibilities.\nIn addition to the two Double Golds, Heng Chi Distillery also won three golds, five silvers, and three bronzes -- its best-ever result at the annual competition."

These are the inventions we are looking for -- something creative, voluntary, and contributing to society,\" Lavergne said.\nA total of 35 Taiwan-based companies showcased 61 patented inventions at the event, making Taiwan the largest foreign delegation.\nAmong the featured inventions were a red fluorescent protein extracted from indigenous algae for use in cell observation and precision medicine, a biomimetic waterproof car coating inspired by the lotus leaf effect, and a multifunctional emergency survival kit.\nTseng Ming-kuo (曾明國), executive officer of Luxwell -- a sports and fitness equipment manufacturer that has participated in the event five times -- told CNA that only new inventions are eligible for entry, and awards are reserved for those that contribute meaningfully to human society.\nHe said Taiwan's entries reflected the country's strong foundation in industries such as semiconductors, electronics, and artificial intelligence (AI).\nMeanwhile, Hsu Chieh (徐捷), head of the Taiwanese delegation, told CNA that branding and health care were the two major trends of the 2025 edition.\nAs the U.S.-China trade war intensifies, contract manufacturing -- with its razor-thin profit margins -- is likely to fade, Hsu said. Companies that excel in branding are more likely to thrive, he added.\nHe also commented on the growing interest in automated and AI-assisted products, especially as both Taiwan and France face aging populations and declining birth rates.\n\"The public is curious to see how these products can help the elderly live better lives,\" he said.\nOnly gold medals were awarded at Friday's ceremony. Silver and bronze medals will be announced on Saturday.\nEstablished in 1901, the Concours Lépine is the world's oldest invention competition.

CNA photo May 10, 2025He was referring to the pressure Trump has been putting on Taiwan companies, particularly those in the high-tech sectors, to expand their manufacturing presence in the U.S., as part of his strategy to boost domestic production and strengthen economic security.Citing a top manager at a major Taiwanese tech company, Lin said that such companies are likely, however, to set up only a basic assembly line in the U.S. \"just to tighten a few screws\" and keep the American government satisfied.TSMC's 'strategic ambiguity'In the case of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), Lin noted that the company plans to expand its investment in the U.S. by US$100 billion to build three new fabrication plants and two new advanced packaging plants in Arizona, in addition to the three fabs it already has in the country.\"Everyone knows it took four years to build the first fab [in Arizona],\" Lin said. \"Now they've announced the recent groundbreaking for the third, but by the time it's completed, Trump will likely have finished his term.\"TSMC has maintained \"strategic ambiguity\" on the other fabs that have yet to be built, Lin said, adding that all six fabs are unlikely to be completed within the next 10 years.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. CNA file photoWhen asked to expand on the \"strategic ambiguity\" concept, Lin said he was not suggesting that TSMC was deliberately delaying construction, but he was taking into consideration the practical factors at play, such as the U.S.' lack of a strong industrial foundation to facilitate that type of production.He also pointed out that in a press release on March 4, TSMC did not specify when the fabs would be completed but instead highlighted the number of jobs they could create in the U.S. over the next decade.Taiwan a potential bargaining chipMeanwhile, Stephen Tan (譚耀南), managing director of the International Policy Advisory Group and an expert on international relations, said that the Taiwan issue might be put on the table during the tariff talks between the U.S. and China in Switzerland this weekend, in light of Trump's recent remarks.On Friday, Trump posted on social media that the U.S.' current 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports may be lowered to 80 percent, which \"seems right.\"In a radio interview on Wednesday, Trump also said that as \"part of the negotiation\" with China, it would be a \"very good idea\" to raise the case of Hong Kong media tycoon and activist Jimmy Lai, who has been imprisoned in Hong Kong since December 2020.Tan drew attention to those two comments by Trump, saying they were an indicator that the talks might not be limited to trade.\"I don't remember the last time Trump showed concern for Jimmy Lai or human rights in Hong Kong,\" Tan said. \"In fact, I don't think I've ever had the impression that he did.\"Tan said Trump is raising issues like human rights and drug trafficking before the talks with China, in an attempt to strengthen the bargaining position of the American delegation, which is being led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.A supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump displays a flag in New York in this CNA file photoOn the Chinese side, Vice Premier He Lifeng (何立峰), a close economic advisor to President Xi Jinping (習近平), is leading the delegation, Tan noted.\"Don't assume that just because the delegations are led by Bessent and He, the talks will only focus on trade,\" Tan said.Each side will likely raise other matters, including the Taiwan issue, if they think it is advantageous and aligns with their interests, he added.Tan said both Trump and Xi seem to have considerable flexibility on trade matters, but it remains to be seen how the U.S. would respond if the Chinese negotiators bring up the Taiwan issue.\"Even if the Chinese side wants to raise the issue, the U.S. side may not be so quick to dive into the deeper waters of geopolitical topics, beyond trade,\" he said.\n(By Sunny Lai) \nEnditem/pc"

The Vatican's diplomacy tends to be measured, he said.\n\"The Vatican typically does not take drastic actions like a U.S. president would - that's not its style,\" Chiang said\nWhile many analysts are focused on the political implications of the Pope's election, Chiang said, the Holy See's primary concerns are religious unity and human global welfare.\nThe Pope's immediate focus will likely be the widespread global suffering, particularly the fallout from ongoing conflicts such as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and tensions between India and Pakistan, Chiang said.\nTaiwan should continue to align its efforts with the Holy See's humanitarian objectives, he said, stressing that Taiwan can help ensure the long-term stability of its relationship with the Vatican by supporting the new Pope's global mission."

I am very happy that I am here, a wonderful country and wonderful people,\" Tsai said.\nTsai said Taiwan and Lithuania share similar fates as both are neighbors to authoritarian countries, referring to China and Russia, respectively.\n\"Despite the threats from outside, we both thrived and developed our economies and became defenders of democracy,\" she said.\nTaiwan and Lithuania are also united by shared values of freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, Tsai said.\nBoth also stand united against threats and challenges from their authoritarian neighbors, she said.\nShe praised the Baltic state for serving as an example to the world that even small countries can make a difference with \"principles and bravery.\"\nTsai was referring to the fact that the warming relations between Taipei and Vilnius have drawn strong opposition from China, which sees Taiwan as part of its territory.\nThe rift between Lithuania and China began in 2021, following the inclusion of \"Taiwanese\" in the name of Taiwan's representative office in Vilnius.\nBeijing strongly objected because Taiwan's representative offices in countries with which it does not have diplomatic ties typically do not use \"Taiwan\" or \"Taiwanese\" in their names, which would imply that Taiwan is a sovereign country, separate from China.\nChina, which sees Taiwan as part of its territory, responded by recalling its ambassador to Vilnius, expelling Lithuania's ambassador to Beijing, suspending direct freight rail service to Lithuania, and severely restricting Lithuanian exports' access to the Chinese market.\nAlthough Lithuania restored diplomatic links with China after a new government assumed power in December 2024, it still insisted on not changing the name of Taiwan's representative office in the nation.\nTsai arrived in Lithuania earlier Saturday local time as the first leg of her ongoing Europe trip that will also take her to Denmark.\nHer first stop in the Baltic state was to visit LeaFood, a vertical farming company that produces sustainable leafy greens, partially established with Taiwanese funding.\nWhile in Lithuania, the former president is also set to deliver a speech at Vilnius University and speak with former Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė, who was in office from 2009 to 2019.\nAfter concluding her visit to the Baltic nation, Tsai will travel to Denmark to speak at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, which will be held in the Danish capital from May 13-14.\nThis trip marks Tsai's second visit to Europe after leaving office last May, completing two four-year terms. She visited the Czech Republic, France, and Belgium in October 2024."

    "content": "Washington, May 11 (CNA) Raymond Greene, director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), said Sunday at an investment summit that Taiwanese companies will be \"critical\" to the achievement of President Donald Trump's goal of re-industrializing the United States.\nGreene made the remarks at a reception for Taiwan's delegation at the U.S. Department of Commerce's 2025 SelectUSA Investment Summit, which is being held in Maryland from Sunday through Wednesday.\nIn a speech welcoming the delegation, Greene noted that only 10 years ago, 80 percent of Taiwan's foreign investment went to the People's Republic of China.\nIn 2024, more of Taiwan's foreign investment went to the United States than to any other country, he said.\nJust as Taiwan's companies were crucial to the industrialization of China 30 years ago, \"we expect Taiwan companies to be just as critical to achieving President Trump's mission for re-industrializing the United States,\" Greene said.\nGreene said the AIT has helped support the growing interest of Taiwan companies in America, particularly in fields like semiconductors, AI, and quantum technology.\nThe Taiwan delegation to the 2025 SelectUSA summit was the largest among all the participants, he noted.\nCabinet Secretary-General Kung Ming-hsin (龔明鑫), who is leading the Taiwan delegation, and Economics Minister Kuo Jyh-huei (郭智輝), also spoke at Sunday's reception, urging the U.S. Congress to pass legislation to prevent double taxation between Taiwan and the U.S.\nThe United States-Taiwan Expedited Double-Tax Relief Act was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in January and must be passed by the Senate and signed by the president to become law.\nIn a statement last week, Taiwan's Cabinet said the delegation to the 2025 SelectUSA Investment Summit would include representatives from industries such as ICT, semiconductors, AI, chemical engineering, biotechnology, smart manufacturing, aerospace, and financial services."

    "date": "2025-05-12",
    "content": "Taipei, May 12 (CNA) Updates to an Executive Yuan webpage on ethnic groups in Taiwan sparked a minor culture war over the weekend, after what critics said was a deliberate attempt to obscure the Han Chinese ethnicity of most Taiwanese.\nThe story first gained attention Saturday, when a user posting on the PTT web forum noted that an Executive Yuan webpage titled \"ethnic groups\" had removed a section referring to Han Chinese as Taiwan's largest ethnicity, comprising 96.4 percent of the total population.\nThe revised version of the page, updated as of March 24, said that of the registered households in Taiwan, 2.6 percent were from Indigenous groups, 1.2 percent were of foreign origin, while 96.2 percent were \"the rest of the population.\"\nAs the changes were picked up by the media, they began drawing sharp criticism from many in the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), who viewed them as an effort by Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government to gloss over any Taiwanese connection to China.\nKMT Legislator Chen Ching-hui (陳菁徽) slammed the page's wording as \"truly absurd,\" questioning why minority groups comprising 3.8 percent of the population would be clearly labeled, while the other 96 percent of people would be vaguely referred to as \"the rest.\"\nThis blurring of Taiwan's ethnic composition \"is not only unhelpful in terms of information transparency, but also makes one suspicious about the motive behind it,\" she said.\nIn a statement to reporters late Saturday, Executive Yuan spokesperson Michelle Lee (李慧芝) said the government publishes such information every year, and that the ethnicities section is based on definitions found in various laws.\nIn December 2022, Control Yuan member Hung Yi-chang (鴻義章) said the term Han Chinese comprises various groups, including the Hoklo people, Hakka people and post-Chinese Civil War immigrants, Lee said.\nOn those grounds, Hung said the use of \"Han\" and \"Indigenous\" as two broad population groups was not conducive to eliminating racial discrimination or promoting equality, and suggested the Interior Ministry's Department of Household Registration adjust the page's wording, Lee said.\nLee said that in Taiwan, only Indigenous people legally register their ethnic status, while foreign resident statistics are based on records of their first household registration.\nWhile there are not detailed statistics on other ethnic groups, it would be inaccurate to classify them all as Han Chinese, she said, though she acknowledged that the Hoklo and Hakka peoples and post-war immigrants from China were all part of the Han Chinese group.\nThe adjustment of the webpage's wording, therefore, was made on the basis of facts, and not any type of political considerations, Lee said."

    "content": "Taipei, May 12 (CNA) A scholar from the United Kingdom on Monday urged Taiwan to strengthen its economic and trade ties with major global powers beyond the United States, given the uncertainties and challenges arising from Donald Trump's return to the White House.\nRobin Niblett, a former distinguished fellow at Chatham House in London, made the recommendation during a forum in Taipei, where he spoke about the ongoing new Cold War between the United States and China.\nIn his keynote speech to open the half-day forum, Niblett, author of the \"The New Cold War: How the Contest Between the U.S. and China Will Shape Our Century,\" told the audiences that given the chaos brought by Trump's second presidential term, Asia Pacific countries, including Taiwan, are poised to face turmoil.\n\"The problem we have is that each side, the United States and China, fears that the other system is a threat to it,\" he said.\nTaiwan is at the center of the First Island Chain that prevents China's expansion.\nWhile America wants to prevent China's rise both militarily and economically, China wants to be economically secure as the world's largest exporter and wishes to \"break out of the First Island Chain,\" which runs from South Korea through Japan and Taiwan, to the northern Philippines, he said.\n\"In that context, I think they [Beijing] believe that Taiwan, in a way, is being used as a kind of missile of democracy, as I describe in my book, against the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n\"And so Taiwan is not just part of the geopolitical contest between the US and China, it is also part of the ideological contest between the two countries.\"\nHowever, unlike his immediate predecessor Joe Biden, Trump \"does not believe in alliances,\" according to the British scholar.\nTo Trump \"allies are the ones to be taken advantage of,\" Niblett argued. \"In fact, it's better off to try to abuse allies because they need you, especially if you're the world's largest consumer market and the provider of your allies' security,\" he added.\nTrump's new approach is creating risks for U.S. allies worldwide, in particular for the Asia Pacific region, including Taiwan, the scholar said.\nGiven the uncertainties and challenges arising from Trump's return to power, Niblett suggested that Taiwan should pursue deeper ties with G7-plus countries beyond the United States.\n\"Taiwan's future lies with the other liberal democracies that rely on America for their security,\" he said.\n\"And therefore, looking for deeper economic relationships and business relationships with the G7-plus countries, EU, UK, Canada, Japan, and Australia would be absolutely vital for Taiwan's future,\" he added.\nNiblett made the remarks during the annual forum organized by the think tank Center for Asia-Pacific Resilience and Innovation (CAPRI).\nThe third edition of the think tank's annual forum is titled \"Building Resilience on Shaky Ground in the Asia Pacific,\" focusing on the steps to take now to build more resilient societies in the future, according to CAPRI."

Backing for same-sex marriage fell to 54.3 percent, down 2.2 percentage points from last year's record high.\nSupport also dipped for related issues, including the belief that people should have equal rights to same-sex marriage regardless of nationality, which fell by 1.4 percentage points to 62.9 percent.\nBacking for the right of same-sex couples to adopt children dropped slightly by 0.4 points to 65.7 percent.\nThe declines suggest that although more gay people are coming out, the government still has work to do in raising public understanding and support, Wong said.\nOne focus of this year's survey was public attitudes toward same-sex couples' reproductive rights, which the Taiwan Equality Campaign referred to as \"unfinished missions.\"\nAccording to the poll, 57.7 percent of respondents supported allowing lesbian couples to have children through assisted reproduction, marking a decrease of 3.7 percentage points from the previous year.\nConcurrently, 43.1 percent supported the right for gay male couples to use a surrogate to have a child, 2.9 percentage points lower than 2024.\nWong urged the government to pass a revised draft of the Assisted Reproduction Act, proposed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in late 2024. This would allow lesbian couples and single women to access assisted reproduction.\nAccording to the Taiwan LGBT Family Rights Advocacy, as of mid-March, the Cabinet had received the Health Ministry's draft, which excludes provisions for surrogacy due to potential controversy and a lack of social consensus.\nThe bill is still pending review by a committee of Ministers without Portfolio. Once approved, it will be submitted to the Legislature along with alternative drafts proposed by lawmakers.\nNo date has been set for the committee meeting.\nThe survey also found that 77.2 percent of respondents said they would be accepting of gay classmates or colleagues, and 71.5 percent said they would be accepting of gay teachers or supervisors.\nMeanwhile, 68.8 percent expressed support for gay political representatives.\nSupport dipped slightly when asked about accepting children who are gay, with 58.8 percent of respondents saying they would.\nTaipei City Councilor Miao Po-ya (苗博雅), who is openly lesbian and attended the event, said the results reflect \"steady progress\" in public awareness. Most declines fell within the survey's 2.98 percent margin of error, she added.\nJoyce Teng (鄧筑媛), the campaign's executive officer, called on the government to invest more in LGBTQ+ education and policy.\n\"Gay and lesbian people are more likely to come out when the government commits more resources to these issues,\" she said.\nThe survey was conducted from April 7 to 9 among adults aged 18 and over."
